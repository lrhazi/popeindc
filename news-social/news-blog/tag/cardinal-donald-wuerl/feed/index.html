class="wp-caption-text">Deacons, accompanied by student volunteers, process to Mass in order to distribute communion.</p></div><p>“Rejoice in the Lord always,” he said. “I’ll say it again: Rejoice in the Lord always.”</p><p>Rather than settling for earthly pleasures and “things that are comfortable,” the Pope told the massive congregation to avoid falling into apathy, “a habit with a fatal consequence: our hearts go numb.”</p><p>Continuing, the Pope said Christians should live out their joyful faith by proclaiming the Gospel to the entire world — going out “to the highways” — and sharing the good news without judgment or condescension.</p><p>“Jesus would not provide a short list of who is or who is not worthy of receiving his presence,” Pope Francis said.</p><p>Pope Francis also spoke highly of St. Junípero, calling him “the embodiment of a church which goes forth.” He said people should follow in his example by following the new saint’s motto in life: “Siempre Adelante,” which translates to “Keep moving forward.”</p><p>The Mass, which was celebrated in Spanish, was intended to shine a light on the diverse Catholic community in the United States and the Washington Metropolitan Area. The program included readings in English and the Native American Chochenyo language. Following the Homily, a Universal Prayer included lines read in Korean, American Sign Language, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Igbo, and Creole.</p><div

The orchestra performed under the direction of Simeone Tartaglione, the orchestra’s music director, while the chamber choir was conducted by Leo Nestor, Justine Bayard Ward Professor and director of choral studies and CUA’s Institute of Sacred Music.</p><p>Several alumni and faculty members composed original works for the visit, including Nestor. Nestor’s compositions for the Mass included the introit, the communion antiphon, and an original work, “I am the Living Bread,” that was performed during the communion rite.</p><p>Following the Holy Eucharist, which was distributed by more than 200 deacons accompanied by student volunteers, Cardinal Donald Wuerl gave a short address to the Pope and those in attendance.</p><p>“Not far from here in 1634, the first Catholics arrived in what is now the United States and began the evangelization effort that we see so wonderfully realized today at this great Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and the campus of The Catholic University of America,” Cardinal Wuerl said.</p><p>“As we seek today to enrich our human culture with the great love — love of God and love of neighbor, we also try to care for our common home, the good earth,” he continued. “We take seriously your call in <em>Laudato Sí</em> to face the challenges of our day and to do so with respect for the dignity of each person; concern for one another, especially the marginalized and the poor; and care for the good earth, God’s gift to us now and for generations to come.”</p><p>Thanking the Holy Father for visiting the University and the United States, Cardinal Wuerl continued:  “We look to you, Holy Father, for renewed inspiration so that we might truly be evangelizers.”</p><p>&gt; <a

This year’s celebrant was Cardinal Donald Wuerl, archbishop of Washington and University chancellor, who asked God to invoke the gifts of the Holy Spirit on the University community to strengthen and guide students, faculty, and staff throughout the 2015-16 academic year.</p><p>In anticipation of Pope Francis’s upcoming visit to the Basilica and the University, Cardinal Wuerl encouraged students to prepare themselves spiritually by working to make a difference in their community.</p><div

We are challenged to take the love and mercy of God and share it with others.”</p><p>The cardinal encouraged students to use this upcoming academic year to continue spiritual formation and to ask God’s help in living their faith.</p><p>“Here at this university, in addition to preparing for a job and a means to a paycheck, we should also accept that we have a deeper calling — to do our part to help make the world just a little better,” he said. “We come together to ask for the gifts of the Holy Spirit because we dare to believe we really can make a difference. We are capable of renewing the face of the earth, or at least trying — at least, doing our part with the help of God.”</p><p>Following the homily, Cardinal Wuerl conferred the Canonical Mission — the authorization to teach in the name of the Church — to William Daniel of the School of Canon Law.</p><p>In his remarks after Mass, University President John Garvey advised students to live the virtue of constancy in their academic, spiritual, and personal lives.</p><div

It is the virtue that gives you the conviction to opt-out of the hookup culture, because you are a child of God made for love far greater than that.”</p><p>Garvey encouraged students to follow Pope Francis’s example of constancy by taking small, concrete steps to follow Christ. Garvey encouraged students to participate in the Archdiocese of Washington’s #WalkwithFrancis initiative by making concrete commitments to pray, serve, and act. Garvey also pledged to participate in the initiative and said he would serve at the Little Sisters of the Poor in Brookland.</p><p>“If we call ourselves Christians, we must affirm that fact in our actions,” Garvey said. “This is constancy.”</p><p>Following Mass, all students who pledged to participate in the initiative received blue wristbands marked #WalkwithFrancis. In his closing remarks, Cardinal Wuerl noted that if everyone wears the bracelets during the papal Mass on Sept. 23, it will be a visual reminder of the University’s commitment to service and prayer.</p><p><iframe

The altar, ambo, and chair were designed as part of a competition at Catholic University’s <a
href="http://architecture.cua.edu/" target="_blank">School of Architecture and Planning</a> sponsored by the Archdiocese of Washington and the Basilica.</p><p>A six-member jury composed of representatives from the archdiocese, Basilica, and Catholic University selected the first-, second-, and third-place winners as well as four honorable mentions.</p><p>In addition to Cardinal Wuerl, today’s public announcement of the winning design at CUA’s School of Architecture and Planning featured University President John Garvey; Monsignor Walter Rossi, rector of the Basilica; Bishop Barry Knestout, auxiliary bishop of Washington and chair of the jury; and Randall Ott, dean of the School of Architecture and Planning.</p><p>The first-place design features arches that mimic the architecture of the Romanesque-Byzantine style Basilica. The chair designed for the Pope features a simple high arch “designed to bring focus not on itself, but on the Vicar of Christ himself who will preach from it,” the team stated in their concept. Members of the winning design team include architecture students Ariadne Cerritelli (Bethesda, Md.), Matthew Hoffman (Pittsburgh), and Joseph Taylor (Eldersburg, Md.).</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Fellow students who participated in the design competition, faculty, and guests congratulate the winning team.</p></div><p>“As we make plans for Pope Francis’s visit here to Washington this September and the Mass he will be celebrating on the east portico of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, it is a joy to be here today as we announce the winning design for the furnishings that will be used at that Mass,” said Cardinal Wuerl. ”The creativity, beauty, and thought that went into each of the submitted designs is a visible sign of God’s grace at work among us in a unique way. We look forward to our Holy Father’s visit here as a time to be confirmed more fully as missionary disciples of our Lord,” he said.</p><p>“I am always impressed and amazed at the variety of designs that can be presented from a limited program of requirements,” added Bishop Knestout. “The liturgical furnishings are simple and small in number — an altar, ambo, and presidential chair — yet these simple elements find expression in a variety of forms, each unique in creativity and beauty, found in all the 18 designs submitted for the competition. The different styles ranged from classical to modern, each reflecting the unique gifts of the teams that had designed them.”</p><p>The Mass will be celebrated during the Pope’s visit to the United States this fall. At the Mass he will canonize Blessed Junipero Serra, the first such ecclesiastical event ever on U.S. soil. Sept. 23 will mark the third time a pope has visited the Basilica and CUA. It will also be the second time CUA students have designed furnishings for a papal visit to Washington, D.C., at the behest of the Archdiocese of Washington.</p><p>The design competition was announced on April 28. Students were informed that their designs needed to be based on the assumption that the papal Mass furnishings could find continued use after Sept. 23 as permanent fixtures inside the Great Upper Church of the Basilica. Thus, students had to consider the interior architecture of the Basilica in their designs.</p><p>“It’s clear to me that the contestants all did their homework. They put a lot of thought and creativity into their designs and rationales,” said Monsignor Rossi.</p><p>Eighteen teams of at least two students each competed. They each had to build a scale model of at least one of the furnishings and make presentations of their designs to the jury on May 15.</p><p>A team of architecture students, Christian Zeitler and John Homer, won second place. The third-place team was interdisciplinary, with architecture students Alyssa Lapan and Brendan Murphy and philosophy student Rev. John Mellein, O.P. Honorable mentions were awarded in the following categories:</p><ul><li
class="first">Meaningful Simplicity: architecture student William Sullivan and politics student Dennis Nilsen</li><li>Noble Simplicity: architecture students Phooko Phooko and Margherita Pongiglione</li><li>Most Innovative Design: architecture students John Abowd and Zach Caplette</li><li
class="last">Best Presentation: architecture students Begona Blasco, Philipe Pessotti, and Alejandra Rossi</li></ul><p>At today’s event the winning team received $6,000, the second-place team $3,000, and third place $2,000. Honorable mention teams each received $1,000.</p><p>In 2008, architecture students designed the furnishings used at the Mass celebrated by Pope Benedict XVI at Nationals Park and the chair he used when he spoke to Catholic educators at CUA.</p><p>“History repeats itself!” remarked Dean Ott. “Never would I have thought that seven years later we would have the opportunity to do this again.”</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/design-for-papal-altar-in-dc-revealed/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Papal Visit Excitement Reflected in Commencement Festivities</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/papal-visit-excitement-reflected-in-commencement-festivities/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/papal-visit-excitement-reflected-in-commencement-festivities/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2015 18:28:46 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Katie Bahr]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Pope at CUA]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Campus Ministry]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Cardinal Donald Wuerl]]></category><guid

href="http://architecture.cua.edu/" target="_blank">School of Architecture and Planning</a> to announce a contest for the design of the altar, chair, and ambo to be used by Pope Francis during the canonization Mass of Blessed Junípero Serra on Sept. 23, 2015.</p><p>“How exciting it is to be here with you on the steps of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception looking out over the campus of The Catholic University of America, where in five months, in this very place, our Holy Father, Pope Francis, will celebrate the canonization of Junípero Serra,” said Cardinal Donald Wuerl, archbishop of Washington and chancellor of CUA. “What makes this even more exciting is that we have all you young people with us. I can’t think of a better way to engage the spirit of the young than through this design competition.”</p><p>The contest marks the second time that CUA students will design furnishings for a papal Mass. In 2008, students designed the altar, ambo, and chair used by Pope Benedict XVI when he celebrated Mass at Nationals Park, and the chair he used when he visited the University.</p><p>Commenting on how often the Basilica and CUA collaborate on events (including University Masses and Commencement), Monsignor Walter Rossi said that he is “delighted” that the architecture and planning school is involved in the preparation for the papal visit. After the visit, he said he hopes to be able to continue using the altar and the other furnishings in the Basilica.</p><p>Bishop Barry Knestout, auxiliary bishop of Washington, also talked briefly with the students about the contest. Bishop Knestout, who has a bachelor’s degree in architecture from the University of Maryland, oversaw the 2008 contest in which students designed the furniture used by Pope Benedict XVI.</p><p>Rev. Ugo Mmebue, a graduate student in architecture from Nigeria, commented that the students are “so privileged to be [at CUA] at this point in time. We’re planning to come up with something that will represent the good work of the School of Architecture and Planning. We will make the furniture something worth seeing. We thank you for giving us this opportunity.”</p><p>“We’re proud to note that when Pope Francis visits Washington we’ll welcome our third pope to campus,” said University President John Garvey. “Participating in the design contest is indeed a special opportunity for our students. I&#8217;m sure it will be an experience of a lifetime for them. I can imagine how exciting it might be to design something that will be here 200 years from now.”</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/cardinal-wuerl-invites-cua-students-to-participate-in-pope-franciss-visit/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
