For one, it takes us through the different times of the Church’s highs and lows, growth and diminishment, glories and shame. In it we find the saga of human drama played out not only in great heroic deeds, which are plenty, but also in the utter failure of some. It truly is a list of sinners and saints. To start with, the first pope himself, St. Peter, did not have an impeccable record. He betrayed his closest friend Jesus at the time when Our Lord needed him the most — not once, but three times! Yet, it was this same Peter whom Jesus continued to love and pray for and then later ordained “to tend his sheep” (Jn 21:16). In the words of Paul, “We hold this treasure in earthen vessels that the surpassing power may be of God and not from us” (2 Cor 4:7).</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Father Eric de la Pena</p></div><p>One of the greatest challenges for the Church today is to prove Her credibility once again to a world where truth is often compromised. Our people’s awareness of clergy abuse not long ago has certainly made preaching more challenging for those who work in the pulpit. Speaking in the name of God no longer brings <em>de facto</em> allegiance of the listeners to the speaker. There are more than words of preaching that must be done if the Word is to become flesh (Jn 1:14). The history of the popes is a testament to everyone that God does not abandon the Church, even when some of Her shepherds have betrayed the sheep multiple times. In Ez 34:15 we hear of God’s promise: “I myself will pasture my sheep.” Thus even when the ship of Peter appears lopsided and seemingly ready to sink, this earthen vessel continues to sail along miraculously above the waters because of the treasury of grace it contains.</p><p>Grace, however, is not magic nor is it automatic, and if God’s grace is to take its effect, it will require a genuine cooperation from us. For this reason, our present Pope strains hard to call everyone back to a deeper conversion, repentance, and practice of humility. He calls us to be merciful and to demonstrate our faith in God not just with words but by the fruit of our actions. This is why at Campus Ministry we strive to combine the word of preaching with works of faith. While we do our best to instill faith in what we say, we also want to see that faith expressed in the loving service of others. Anyone who comes to our office can see that there are tons of available opportunities for students to serve and make a difference in the lives of others through volunteer work and faith development. This is what Pope Francis calls the New Evangelization — it is that credible preaching once again as witnessed by word and deed.</p><p><em>— <a
