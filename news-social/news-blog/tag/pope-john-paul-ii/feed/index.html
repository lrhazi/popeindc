But, now and again, when I look at photos of Pope John Paul II’s 1979 visit to CUA, I can’t help but wish that I had been here to enjoy that visit as I was for Pope Benedict XVI and hope to be for Pope Francis. I was, at the time, in grammar school in New York and I remember watching Pope John Paul II’s visit unfold on my parents’ tiny black-and-white television in those dark ages before the Internet and social media. I also remember having a day or two of much-appreciated school holidays when the papal entourage made its way to New York. But, in anticipation of Pope Francis’s historic visit here, my thoughts have turned again to Saint John Paul II — the first pope I really remember and the pope who shaped my youth and young adulthood as part of the “John Paul II generation.” I remember the way he confronted a broken world in the vigor of his youth, and how he faced very public suffering and death with the serenity of his old age.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Lucia Silecchia</p></div><p>This spring, I had a chance to think again about Saint John Paul II in a more personal way when I traveled to Wadowice, his hometown, and visited the sites important to his youth. I saw the parish church where he was baptized and the baptismal font where, in his words, “it all began.” I saw the town square where he played with his young friends — many of whom would not see much of adulthood, losing their lives in the death camps or on the battlefields that would quickly engulf their lives. I saw the programs from his high school drama productions, and thought about how different the world would be if he had followed his early ambitions to be a poet or an actor. I saw the photos of the family he lost — a sister he never knew, a beloved mother who died when he was only 9, a brother studying medicine who died treating the ill, and a devoted father who passed from this life before young Karol was ever ordained a priest. I saw the dining hall where his father took him to eat when the two lived alone, and I saw the orphanage run by religious sisters who cared for him as a boy during the times when his father could not. In the interest of historic inquiry, I ate at a few bakeries that each claimed to sell the very crème cakes he enjoyed as a boy, and in the interest of curiosity, I visited the museum devoted to his life.</p><p>But, perhaps most intimately, I visited his childhood home. A three-room flat on the second floor of a modest building, there was a simple bedroom he shared with his father, a small kitchen, and a neat sitting room that went unused after the shadow of his mother’s death fell on the home. In those few rooms, he grew up and came to know the God who would sustain him in the many sufferings he knew in youth, the blessed Mother who would comfort him in the trials of his life, and the understanding of what it is to live with fear and hope, with joy and sorrow, with great love and great loss.</p><p>This home was located just across an alley from the parish church where Karol and his father would go to Mass each morning. What caught my eye was a large sundial mounted on the side of the church — a sundial now marked with the precise time of Saint John Paul II’s death. Over the sundial was a Polish inscription that read, “Czas Ucieka Wiecznosc Czeka” or, “Time Flies, Eternity Waits.” That made an impression on me, and so, of course, I had to go to the gift shop and buy a picture of the sundial to keep in my office.</p><p>“Time Flies, Eternity Waits.” These were words that young Karol would have seen out of his window every day and they are, I think, important words to live by. In a <a
href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2616323">recent talk I gave to a group of lawyers</a>, I mentioned that one of the most frequent replies we give to the question, “How are you?” is “I’m busy.” I’m not sure whether lawyers or Washingtonians are more prone to busy-ness than others, but I do know that it is so easy to get caught up in the things that make time fly. But, perhaps what gave Saint John Paul II the serenity, courage, and fortitude to live the life he did was knowing that in spite of all that makes time fly here on earth, it is eternity that waits — patiently and peacefully. Perhaps that is a reminder in the days ahead to do what is urgent, pressing, and necessary — but not at the expense of those things that are truly important because they point our way toward eternity. I would like to think that now, in the peaceful joy of eternity, Saint John Paul II prays much and often for his busy successor. I would also like to think that as the days leading up to Pope Francis’s visit fly by, that we will find much to remind us of the eternity that awaits us all.</p><p><em>— <a

See below.</h6><p>For the Catholic faithful, a papal visit is always historic.</p><p>For one university in the nation’s capital, the upcoming visit of Pope Francis provides special bragging rights: It will be the third papal stop at the Catholic University of America in less than 40 years.</p><p>Pope John Paul II came in 1979, and his successor, Pope Benedict XVI, came in 2008.</p><p>The university in Northeast Washington is a natural destination for a traveling pontiff. Founded in 1887 under a papal charter, Catholic U. is overseen by a board that includes numerous bishops and other church clerics. It is not just affiliated with the church; it is the church’s national university in the United States. Catholic U. has schools in fields such as nursing, business, philosophy, engineering, music, arts and sciences. It has a law school and a school of canon law.</p><p>The announcement of the pope’s visit was well-timed for the university. It informed its community, including admitted students, of the plans on April 27. That was just before the May 1 deadline for admitted students to decide where to enroll.</p><p>University officials are busy planning for the gathering on Sept. 23. On that day, Francis plans to celebrate Mass outdoors on the east portico of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. During the service, to be held in Spanish, the pope will canonize the 18th-century missionary Blessed Junípero Serra.</p><p>Officials told The Washington Post this week that the 6,700 students at the university will get that Wednesday off. Most classes also will be canceled the evening before. But officials said they are trying to impress on students that it’s not just about a celebrity coming to campus. “This is first and foremost a religious experience and the first canonization Mass in the U.S.,” said university spokesman Victor Nakas.</p><p>&gt; <a

class="wp-caption-text">John Garvey</p></div><p>These are the Kodak Moments of the papal visits (today, I suppose they would be Instagrammed). As we prepare to welcome Pope Francis to campus on September 23, these are the sorts of moments we imagine and look forward to.</p><p>But there are also many practical preparations that are inevitable parts of such an event. The Facilities Maintenance and Operations staff at the University are busy preparing the grounds for the papal visit. Folding chairs must be rented. Audio and video systems will have to be set up for recording and broadcasting the papal Mass. These sorts of preparations are less exciting than the actual visit. Such practical matters can seem like distractions from more spiritual things. And they can be. It reminds me of the story of Martha and Mary in the Gospel of Luke. Martha is so busy preparing things and serving Jesus that she misses out on his visit, while her sister Mary sits at the Lord’s feet.</p><p>But there is another story in the gospels that also comes to my mind as we prepare our campus to welcome Pope Francis. Before he celebrated the Last Supper, Jesus sent his disciples to make arrangements for securing the upper room to celebrate the Passover. They went into the city, they scouted out the space, and they made a reservation. These utterly practical matters were part of the preparation for the institution of the Eucharist.</p><p>Christ established a visible Church, a Church that has faces and takes up space and occasionally sits in folding chairs. And as the Second Vatican Council observed in <em>Lumen Gentium</em>, the dogmatic constitution on the Church, the visible and spiritual elements of the Church are not two separate realities, “They form one complex reality which coalesces from a divine and a human element.” One of the most remarkable things about our faith is that we believe that God works through these human elements to accomplish his plan for the world.</p><p>Seen in this light, the <a

class="wp-caption-text">John Convey</p></div><p>It will be a thrill to be present at the Mass celebrated by Pope Francis in September. It’s a great honor for the University and a tribute to the University’s contributions to the Church. This visit will mark the third time that a pope has visited CUA. I was also present during the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1979 and for the visit of Pope Benedict XVI in 2008. For Pope John Paul’s visit all the faculty was gathered in the old gymnasium, which now houses the School of Architecture and Planning. Cameras were popping everywhere when he entered the building. I was also fortunate to be invited with Catholic educators all over the country to hear Pope Benedict speak in the Great Room of the Pryzbyla Center in 2008. They say, “The third time is a charm.” I look forward to the visit in September.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Marion Gosney, Director, Office of Alumni Relations</strong></p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Marion Gosney</p></div><p>I was on campus for Pope Benedict’s visit in 2008. I had no idea how exciting it would be! It started with local news tracking the journey of the (vacant) popemobile to campus. Numerous news trucks with 20-foot antennas lined the sidewalk in front of McMahon, where our office was, three or four days before the event. Recognizable news anchors could be seen around campus. I volunteered both days of the papal visit, directing visitors to campus and then assisting journalists while perched on scaffolding, and would not have missed the scene for anything!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Victor Nakas, Associate Vice President for Public Affairs</strong></p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Victor Nakas</p></div><p>I’ve only had the experience of seeing one pope at the University. I remember well the dozens of TV trucks that were arrayed on our campus, some of them in front of McMahon Hall. We had hundreds of journalists who were either in the Pryz or on the University Mall or University Lawn during that two-day period. Many of them used a press center that we set up on campus for them. It was an incredibly exciting time for the members of our communications committee. It was also one of the most complicated projects I’ve ever been associated with. I’m fortunate that about half of the current staff in the Office of Public Affairs was involved in helping organize Pope Benedict’s visit, so we can apply that collective experience to the upcoming visit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Frank Persico, Vice President for University Relations and Chief of Staff</strong></p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Frank Persico</p></div><p>I have been blessed to see two popes on our campus and to be involved in planning for a third. Pope John Paul II came to Catholic University in 1979. What I remember most vividly about the visit was when the Holy Father walked down the center aisle of what is now the Crough Center. It was decorated from top to bottom — it was our gym at the time, as folks may know. The security was nothing like it is these days. I was a volunteer usher in that aisle at the event and when the Pope walked by, I put out my hand and he brushed up against it — a quick attempt at a handshake. I remember it today as if it just happened.</p><p>When Pope Benedict came to campus in 2008, students had the chance to see him twice. On April 16 he came to the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception to meet with the U.S. bishops. Crowds (about 11,000 folks) gathered on the University Mall were able to see him enter the Basilica via the east steps (the same area where Pope Francis will celebrate Mass). The next day he came to the Pryz to deliver an address in the Great Room. Students gathered on the University Lawn (between the Pryz and the law school) had a chance to see Pope Benedict coming and going to the Pryz and to view his address on a jumbo screen. If someone were to ever ask me what my greatest accomplishment at Catholic University is, I would say without a doubt that planning a venue for our students to see the Holy Father and watch both his Mass at Nationals Park and the address on that jumbo screen would be it. Most students, I recall, wore baseball-type shirts with the name “Benedict” on the back along with the number “16.” That whole scene was really special.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Shavaun Wall, Professor of Education</strong></p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Shavaun Wall</p></div><p>I was in the audience for Pope Benedict’s presentation in the Great Room of the Pryz. It was an honor to be among representatives of Catholic education (both Catholic schools and Catholic colleges and universities) from across our nation who heard the Pope’s thoughts on education. The campus community provided a tremendous welcome. I remember being seated just three rows away from the special chair the architecture students designed, awaiting the Pope&#8217;s arrival. The lawn behind the Pryz was packed with students, faculty, and community members. A great roar went up when the Pope arrived. There was such anticipation, then the joy of the visit.</p><p>Pope John Paul II visited very early in my career at CUA. This was years before the Pryz was built. So the Pope addressed the faculty and guests in what is now the Crough Center (but at that time was CUA&#8217;s gym!). CUA transformed the gym with white and gold draping. The faculty wore academic attire. We were very excited to be present. I never imagined that three popes would visit CUA during my career. CUA really does enjoy a special relationship with the Holy See.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/faculty-staff-reflect-on-previous-papal-visits/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>A History of CUA Papal Visits</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/a-history-of-cua-papal-visits/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/a-history-of-cua-papal-visits/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2015 16:10:36 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[rbaldizon]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[News]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Pope at CUA]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Pope Benedict XVI]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Pope John Paul II]]></category><guid

The visit will mark the third time a pope has come to the campus of Catholic University. Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI visited the campus in 1979 and 2008, respectively.</p><p>The papal visits highlight Catholic University’s role as the national University of the Catholic Church in the United States.</p><p><strong>1979<br
/> </strong>The University community only had seven weeks to prepare for Pope John Paul II’s visit, which took place on Oct. 7, 1979. Prior to the visit, the University called upon the services of a special-events decorating team to transform the old University gym into a site suitable for the pope’s address. The work crew attached pipes to the gym ceiling and hung yards of drapery. They also built a wooden stage out of theatrical risers, decorated the walls with CUA seals and banners, covered the gym with red carpeting and assembled flower arrangements.</p><p>On the day of the visit, Pope John Paul II first visited the Shrine (which had not yet been raised to basilica status), where CUA students lined the steps and cheered. Later, the pope delivered a major speech on Catholic higher education on campus. The crowd of 2,000 people included 240 heads of Catholic institutions of higher learning from around the country.</p><p>During his address, Pope John Paul II told the audience, “I cannot help but feel at home with you.” He called CUA a “great institution” and affirmed the responsibility of a Catholic university to set up “a real community which bears witness to a living and operative Christianity, a community where sincere commitment to scientific research and study goes together with a deep commitment to authentic Christian living.”</p><p>The University chorus and orchestra performed several times during the program including a hymn prepared by music professor Robert Ricks, “Serdeczna Matko.” The Pope’s visit to D.C. culminated with a Mass on the Washington Mall for approximately a million people.</p><p><strong>2008<br
/> </strong>When Pope Benedict XVI came to Catholic University in 2008, the University community had more time to prepare and, as a result, students played a larger role. In August 2007, Very Rev. David M. O’Connell, C.M., then President of the University, learned the Pope would deliver an important address on Catholic education in April 2008.</p><div

Architecture students were commissioned to design the altar, papal chair, pulpit, and lectern to be used during the Mass celebrated by Pope Benedict XVI at Nationals Park. A choir of 17 music students were selected from the Benjamin T. Rome School of Music to perform the eighth-century chant “<em>Laudes Regiae: Christus Vincit</em>,” as the Pope entered the University center&#8217;s Great Room.</p><p>On April 16, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI visited the Basilica to meet with U.S. bishops and preside over Solemn Vespers in the Crypt Church. While there, he greeted a crowd of thousands students and alumni who had gathered on the University Mall.</p><p>The next day, the Pope returned to campus and delivered his address on education at the Edward J. Pryzbyla University Center before a packed audience of more than 400 Catholic educators. While the Pope spoke, more than 1,000 students gathered on the lawn of CUA’s Columbus School of Law to watch the address live on a JumboTron.</p><p>During his address, Pope Benedict XVI greeted his audience as “bearers of wisdom” and spoke of education’s integral place in the Church’s mission to proclaim the Good News. Stressing the high expectations society places on Catholic educators, he told the audience that such expectation “places upon you a responsibility and offers an opportunity.”</p><p>The Pope spoke of &#8220;the difficulty or reluctance many people have today in entrusting themselves to God,&#8221; especially the younger generation. Thus, he told the audience, &#8220;A particular responsibility for each of you, and your colleagues, is to evoke among the young the desire for the act of faith.&#8221;</p><p>&gt; <a
