Before the press conference began, reporters got to witness staff members from the Office of Facilities Maintenance and Operations remove a light pole that stood in the way of the view of the East Portico of the Shrine.</p><p>Catholic University President John Garvey; Cardinal Donald Wuerl, archbishop of Washington and University chancellor; and Monsignor Walter Rossi, rector of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, took a brief tour of the work underway on the Shrine, including a close-up inspection of the roof and stage that will be the visual centerpiece of next week’s Mass.</p><p>During the press conference, President Garvey, Monsignor Rossi, and Cardinal Wuerl all noted the work three <a

But because the altar will have to be used outdoors for the Pope’s Mass and then moved indoors, where it will remain in use in the Great Upper Church, it was decided that it should be built out of lighter materials and faux painted. Artists will apply the faux painting while the altar is inside the Basilica in order to ensure it matches the marble already in place there.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/papal-altar-arrives-at-the-basilica/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Papal Furnishings Draw Local and National Media Attention</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/papal-furnishings-draw-local-and-national-media-attention/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/papal-furnishings-draw-local-and-national-media-attention/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:23:18 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Katie Bahr]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[News]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Pope at CUA]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Preparing for the Pope]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Altar Design]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Alumni]]></category> <category><![CDATA[architecture]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Media]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Students]]></category><guid

The furniture was designed as part of a competition among CUA students in April. The winning designers — recent architecture graduates (pictured above, from left) Ariadne Cerritelli, Matthew Hoffman, and Joseph Taylor — patiently participated in four hours of interviews Monday afternoon while also trying to take quick breaks to talk to the builders and see their designs coming to life.</p><p>The furniture is being built by Deacon Dave Cahoon, a carpenter and ordained deacon for the Archdiocese of Washington, with assistance from Doug Fauth at Carriage Hill Cabinets. Assisting Deacon Dave — both in building the furniture and in the media event Monday — were other local craftsmen including Lawrence Wroten, who carved the papal seal onto what will become the back of the Pope’s chair, and Karen Kouneski, who is working on the mosaic that will be installed in the center arch of the altar. Deacon Dave’s employee Carlos Hernandez continued working on the altar through much of the media event.</p><p>Cerritelli and Hoffman are continuing with master’s degree studies at CUA this fall. Taylor is working for an architecture firm in Annapolis, Md.</p><p>To view stories resulting from this media event, visit <a
