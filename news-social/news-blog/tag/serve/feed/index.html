Every year, about two weeks before classes start all of the student leaders come back to campus for training. This year during training there was a lot of talk about Pope Francis’s upcoming visit. We even had an entire presentation on it! Needless to say, we are pretty excited for Pope Francis to visit our beloved campus.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Greta Haussmann</p></div><p>With all of this excitement in the air, I have been reminding myself to look past the frenzy and focus on preparing myself for the Holy Father’s visit. Most of my preparation has been focused on my demeanor, while some preparation has taken the form of service. Regarding my demeanor: I decided to take time to reflect upon the things that I love most about our Holy Father, and what came to mind were his simplicity, his graciousness, and his humility. I have chosen to take time in prayer and in my actions to work on cultivating simplicity, graciousness, and humility in my life. Regarding service, I have pledged to #WalkWithFrancis by committing time to service. During student leader training, I had the opportunity to participate in a day of service with Centennial Village staff in the Brookland community by helping facilitate a “Community Day” at a local park.</p><p>Serving in this capacity was a fruitful experience and it reminded me of the value of community and outreach; but I also know that Pope Francis calls Christians to something deeper than one-time service. Pope Francis says, “To be Christian is to do what Jesus did — serve. To be Christian isn’t about appearances or social conduct, it isn’t putting a bit of makeup on the soul so that it’s a little more beautiful.” It is important for us to remember that as Christians we are called to continuous service. However, it is equally important to remember that we are called to authenticity in our lives of service. Pope Francis is calling us to be genuine with our fellow Christians in our words and actions — he is calling us to serve as we are, not as we believe we ought to be.</p><p>As a student leader on the Catholic University campus I feel called to live a life of service, rather than making service an isolated event. Furthermore, I find Pope Francis’s words regarding what it means to be Christian quite relevant to serving as a student leader — being a leader is not about being perfect, once again, it is about being authentic. Pope Francis has taught me the importance of being a genuine witness as a student leader here at CUA. As we continue to prepare for the papal visit, I challenge you to live a life of authentic service and leadership.</p><p><em>— Greta Haussmann is a junior at <a

href="http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/linda-plitt-donaldson-everything-is-connected-caring-for-gods-creation/">previous blog</a>, I noted that Pope Francis has recognized the power of and need for grassroots movements to help build a just society where the economy functions at the service of the people. In calling for such action, Pope Francis stands with 125 years of Catholic social teaching beginning with <a
href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html">Rerum Novarum</a>, when Pope Leo the XIII addressed the rights of workers to organize and be paid a just wage to support their families. In <a
href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-xxiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_11041963_pacem.html">Pacem in Terres</a>, Pope John XXIII referenced organizing efforts when observing that the “longstanding inferiority complex of certain classes because of their economic and social status, sex, or position … is rapidly becoming a thing of the past.”</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Linda Plitt Donaldson</p></div><p>In <a
href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_30121987_sollicitudo-rei-socialis.html">Sollicitudo rei Socialis </a>Pope John Paul II used the example of the “nonviolent demonstrations [of the poor] to present their needs and rights to oftentimes corrupt and inefficient authorities” as a “positive sign …[of a] growing … solidarity.” And now Pope Francis is putting hope in the power of community <a
href="http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/07/10/pope_francis_speech_at_world_meeting_of_popular_movements/1157291">organizing</a> to restore dignity to the poor and to care for our common home.</p><p>In 1970, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops passed a resolution to start the Campaign for Human Development to address the structural causes of poverty by supporting the self-help efforts of communities to fight for and defend their right to live and flourish in a manner consistent with their dignity. For 45 years <a
href="http://www.usccb.org/about/catholic-campaign-for-human-development/">CCHD</a> has been standing in solidarity with low-income communities in their efforts to demand justice and create economic opportunities that offer living-wage jobs.</p><p>The <a
href="http://www.piconetwork.org/">PICO National Network,</a> founded by Jesuit priest Rev. John Bauman in 1972, has organized a <a
href="http://www.piconetwork.org/tell-the-pope">#TellthePope</a> campaign to highlight for the Pope the profound economic and racial challenges being experienced by families and communities in the United States. Through their <a
href="http://www.piconetwork.org/year-of-encounter-confronting-the-economy-of-exclusion">Year of Encounter</a> campaign, PICO is challenging communities to engage in “radical encounters of inclusion and to organize for workers’ rights.” At the <a
href="http://www.worldmeeting2015.org/">World Meeting of Families</a> in Philadelphia, they hope to convey the message to Pope Francis that poverty and racism are critical issues in the United States that ravage families and perpetuate the cycle of poverty.</p><p>Social workers have long been involved in organizing. They have organized and fought for the rights of children, women, workers, people of color, and people who are poor. The profession includes social justice giants such as <a
href="http://www.naswfoundation.org/pioneers/h/height.htm">Dorothy Height</a>, <a
href="http://www.naswfoundation.org/pioneers/y/WYoung.htm">Whitney Young</a>, and <a
href="http://www.naswfoundation.org/pioneers/d/dellums.htm">Ron Dellums</a> and lesser-known organizing heroes such as <a
href="http://www.naswfoundation.org/pioneers/c/chan.html">Diana Ming Chan</a> and <a
href="http://www.naswfoundation.org/pioneers/p/pantoja.htm">Antonia Pantoja</a>.</p><p>Social workers continue to be engaged in organizing for social justice on a range of issues. For example, Elizabeth Alex is the lead organizer for <a
href="http://wearecasa.org/">Casa de Maryland</a>, fighting for the rights of immigrants. Hannah Kane is organizing for the rights of workers with the <a
href="http://www.dcejc.org/">DC Employment Justice Center</a>. Adam Schneider is fighting for the rights of people who are homeless with <a
href="http://www.hchmd.org/">Health Care for the Homeless</a> in Baltimore.</p><p>The social work profession is largely known for the clinical and direct services it provides to vulnerable and marginalized populations. Yet, the profession also has a legacy of community organizing and social reform that enables it to address both immediate needs and structural causes of poverty and human suffering. Catholics refer to that as walking with <a
href="http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/catholic-social-teaching/two-feet-of-love-in-action.cfm">two feet of love in action</a>. This is what Pope Francis is calling all of us to do, and the social work profession walks tall and proud with him in our shared vision of justice, mercy, and compassion in the world.</p><p><em>– <a

This year’s celebrant was Cardinal Donald Wuerl, archbishop of Washington and University chancellor, who asked God to invoke the gifts of the Holy Spirit on the University community to strengthen and guide students, faculty, and staff throughout the 2015-16 academic year.</p><p>In anticipation of Pope Francis’s upcoming visit to the Basilica and the University, Cardinal Wuerl encouraged students to prepare themselves spiritually by working to make a difference in their community.</p><div

We are challenged to take the love and mercy of God and share it with others.”</p><p>The cardinal encouraged students to use this upcoming academic year to continue spiritual formation and to ask God’s help in living their faith.</p><p>“Here at this university, in addition to preparing for a job and a means to a paycheck, we should also accept that we have a deeper calling — to do our part to help make the world just a little better,” he said. “We come together to ask for the gifts of the Holy Spirit because we dare to believe we really can make a difference. We are capable of renewing the face of the earth, or at least trying — at least, doing our part with the help of God.”</p><p>Following the homily, Cardinal Wuerl conferred the Canonical Mission — the authorization to teach in the name of the Church — to William Daniel of the School of Canon Law.</p><p>In his remarks after Mass, University President John Garvey advised students to live the virtue of constancy in their academic, spiritual, and personal lives.</p><div

It is the virtue that gives you the conviction to opt-out of the hookup culture, because you are a child of God made for love far greater than that.”</p><p>Garvey encouraged students to follow Pope Francis’s example of constancy by taking small, concrete steps to follow Christ. Garvey encouraged students to participate in the Archdiocese of Washington’s #WalkwithFrancis initiative by making concrete commitments to pray, serve, and act. Garvey also pledged to participate in the initiative and said he would serve at the Little Sisters of the Poor in Brookland.</p><p>“If we call ourselves Christians, we must affirm that fact in our actions,” Garvey said. “This is constancy.”</p><p>Following Mass, all students who pledged to participate in the initiative received blue wristbands marked #WalkwithFrancis. In his closing remarks, Cardinal Wuerl noted that if everyone wears the bracelets during the papal Mass on Sept. 23, it will be a visual reminder of the University’s commitment to service and prayer.</p><p><iframe

The #WalkwithFrancis initiative coincides with the “Share the Joy, Walk with Francis” theme for the D.C. leg of the Pope’s visit.</p><p>Below, Jackie Sardina, a 2015 graduate from Yorba Linda, Calif., with degrees in theology and philosophy and a music minor, reflects on a mission trip to Costa Rica with other CUA students in May. The trip was sponsored by CUA’s Office of Campus Ministry. Sardina also has committed to a year of service in Ecuador with Rostro de Cristo, a volunteer and retreat group immersion program.</p><div
style="font-size: 14px;" id="blockquote-584f0f2d13742" class="mk-shortcode mk-blockquote quote-style "><p>Our mission trip to Costa Rica was an incredible and eye-opening experience for us. In total we had 13 people, including Father Eric [de la Pena] who works in Campus Ministry with faith formation. We learned so much from our volunteer experiences and from the other students we met and befriended on our mission. Some of us helped paint schools and played with children, others worked at a shelter for homeless men. I was very thankful that I was able to care for mentally and physically disabled men and women at a center run by the Missionary Sisters of the Redemptive Heart of Christ. I was inspired by the sisters and their relentless love and care for their patients, who were often times difficult to handle and required intense physical aid. These sisters would wake up at 4:30 a.m. and go to sleep at 11 p.m. caring for these people who depend completely upon the sisters to give them a dignified living when no one else would give them one. I was also inspired by the joy and the humility of the residents of the center. The residents&#8217; disabilities kept them from taking care of themselves; even the simplest things such as eating or going to the bathroom were difficult. But they were always smiling and always ready to love whoever would give them a moment of their time. Lastly, I was inspired by the other CUA volunteers. It was an incredible sight to see them giving of themselves so freely to the people we met and to hear their stories about how their experiences in Costa Rica were changing and challenging them to be people of service. I am so thankful for our mission trip experience in Costa Rica and I am so inspired by the people I met there.</p></div><p><em>Want to share how you #WalkwithFrancis? Send us a photo via <span

Some of the highlights included a six-hour bus ride from Belize City to Punta Gorda, days of working in the hot sun building a playhouse for a local preschool, mixing concrete to build a sidewalk, tutoring students at a local elementary school, and meeting and interacting with locals, including being challenged to a volleyball tournament.</p></div><p><em>Want to share how you have been #WalkwithFrancis?
