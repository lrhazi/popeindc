In October 2013 the council had a private audience with the Holy Father. The Grabowskis were the first couple selected to come forward and greet him (though the Pope would eventually greet everyone in the room). When he had the opportunity to do so, Grabowski, asked the Pope to pray for Claire, as she had been in the hospital the month before.</p><p>“Without hesitation, Pope Francis placed his hand on Claire&#8217;s head and prayed over her,” John says. “It was an unexpected but wonderful gesture, which made the meeting even more memorable.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/encountering-pope-francis-john-grabowski/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
