class="wp-caption-text">Lucia Silecchia</p></div><p>As I think of Pope Francis’s time here with us, and his celebration of the canonization Mass in our midst, there are many things, some quick snapshots that I will always remember:</p><p>The joy of the crowd that grew each minute that the Mass drew closer.</p><p>The random meetings with people from so many parts of my life — my parish, my circle of friends, my students, my colleagues, and even my local Dunkin Donuts — all gathered in the same place for the same sacred reason.</p><p>The lump that came to my throat when the carillon rang out our joyful expectation.</p><p>The remarkable simplicity of the canonization rite.</p><p>Hearing “<em>Rejoice in the Lord always</em> …” and realizing that one of my favorite scripture passages, the one I read at my brother’s wedding, was the one I was about to hear proclaimed on yet another special day.</p><p>The hymns both familiar and new that praised God in the many ways we strive to capture awe and love in song.</p><p>The jubilant laps in the Popemobile and the reverence of the Mass that followed.</p><p>The expected smiles of sharing the day with loved ones, and the unexpected tears that came from realizing that there are loved ones with whom I can no longer share great days like this. (Gratefully, tears not captured on the JumboTron.)</p><p>And the gift of receiving the Eucharist in that unexplained moment filled with the paradox that the most quiet and intimate moment with God can be in a crowd of thousands.</p><p>Were I to write about all these things, this post would be far too long! So, instead, I’ll let the last words be Pope Francis’s. As he prepared to leave the United States, his parting remarks began:</p><blockquote><p><em>“My days with you have been brief. But they have been days of great grace for me and, I pray, for you too. Please know that as I prepare to leave, I do so with a heart full of gratitude and hope.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Indeed, his days with us were brief. They were days of great grace for me and, I pray, for you too. As he prepared to leave, I saw him do so with a heart full of gratitude and hope.</p><p><em>— <a

class="wp-caption-text">Members of the CUA Symphony Orchestra are seen in Ward Hall hours before the Papal Mass.</p></div><p>“It’s such an amazing experience,” she said. “It still hasn’t quite hit me how big of a deal this is. I think my brain knows it, but I don’t know if I’m going to really understand it for a little while.”</p><p>DeGeorgia was also excited that the Pope would come to her own University campus.</p><p>“It’s so special for the people who are here right now,” she said. “As musicians, our goal for today is to glorify God through the gifts we’ve been given.”</p><p>Christine Laird, a master’s student and member of the chamber choir, was walking toward Ward Hall at the same time. She said she also had a hard time comprehending what the day would be like.</p><p>“We’ve been rehearsing for several weeks, but I don’t think we quite get the magnitude of it,” she said. “I don&#8217;t think it will be until it’s all put together, when all the people are here, that we will finally understand and see what we are singing for. It’s going to be really overwhelming.”</p><p>Downstairs in Ward Hall, a trio of brass players were retrieving their instruments and warming up in the piano lab.</p><p>Junior Matthew Fitzsimmons, a trumpet player, said he felt honored and excited to be playing a role in today’s papal Mass.</p><p>“It’s hard to believe that it’s actually happening,” he said. “I’ve never been part of something this big. It’s a huge honor.”</p><p>Freshman Christopher Gillie, a french horn player, was also warming up before the Mass, which more than 25,000 people are expected to attend.</p><p>“This is definitely nerve-wracking,” he said. “This is the largest audience I’ll probably ever play for — probably the largest audience anyone here will ever play for.”</p><p>Having only started college a month ago, Gillie said the rehearsals for the papal Mass were a great way to meet other students, alumni, and local musicians.</p><p>“I didn’t know I’d have this opportunity,” he said. “It’s a pretty cool way to start my college career.”</p><p>Faculty member Eric Moore, who teaches french horn, was also eagerly awaiting the day’s Mass. A former member of the U.S. Navy Band, Moore said he has played for presidents and other government officials in the past, but that playing for a pope is unique.</p><p>“I came up here on the Metro and saw people who have come from long distances for this,” Moore said. “As a musician, this is different. It’s not like playing for a military or political figure. This is something bigger than that and more inspiring than that.”</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/university-musicians-our-goal-is-to-glorify-god/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Campus Filled With Activity the Day Before Papal Visit</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/campus-filled-with-activity-the-day-before-papal-visit/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/campus-filled-with-activity-the-day-before-papal-visit/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2015 20:29:57 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Katie Bahr]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[News]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Pope at CUA]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Preparing for the Pope]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Alumni]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Basilica]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Faculty]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Media]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Music]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Preparations]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Students]]></category><guid

Mullen of Denver Library. Faculty experts have been speaking with the media, including President John Garvey, who joined reporter Lester Holt from NBC Nightly News for an interview on the roof of O’Connell Hall.</p><p>The liturgical committee is in high gear at the Basilica, preparing the altar, hanging the crucifix, and preparing tens of thousands of communion wafers — including a low-gluten variety — for tomorrow’s Mass.</p><p>Elsewhere on campus, students are navigating new routes as they walk between classes, which are still in session. In addition to the large number of bike racks put in place earlier this month for security reasons, students now face new obstacles: rows of porta-potties, ATMs, and quickly constructed food and souvenir stands.</p><p>Many students have been finding time during the day to investigate the scene on the University Mall, where 15,000 seats have been set up and numbered in preparation for the canonization Mass.</p><div

Pryzbyla University Center, where the office of Jon Sawyer, associate vice president for student affairs and the dean of students, was distributing 700 tickets for students to view the Pope’s address to a joint meeting of Congress from the West Front of the Capital. The tickets were awarded to the University from the House of Representatives.</p><p>Freshman Briana Marcinauskis was among the students who received a ticket to the Capital.</p><p>“I was going back and forth (on whether I wanted the tickets) because I know I’m going to be so tired, but then I thought, ‘It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she said. “I got down (to the Pryzbyla Center) and they had five left so I grabbed two of them.”</p><p>Walking around campus the day before Pope Francis’s visit is “a little overwhelming,” Marcinauskis said. “Hearing all the music all day has been crazy, but people are really excited.”</p><p><iframe

Rome School of Music gathered in Ward Hall Thursday for a joint rehearsal of the repertoire to be performed during next week’s papal Mass. The musicians, representing both the CUA Chamber Choir and the University Symphony Orchestra, will be among those performing as Pope Francis canonizes Blessed Junípero Serra on Sept. 23.</p><p>Professor Simeone Tartaglione is conductor of the orchestra, which is composed of 40 students, faculty, and alumni. The orchestra began rehearsals on Sept. 3.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Leo Nestor, conductor of the University Chamber Choir, leads a rehearsal in Ward Hall.</p></div><p>“Even with the limited number of rehearsals we had, everyone stepped up to the challenge and prepared for a wonderful performance, inspired by the shining personality of Pope Francis,” said Tartaglione.</p><p>Professor Leo Nestor, who will be conducting the orchestra and chamber choir of 28 singers during the Mass, said he is looking forward to Wednesday’s papal Mass. Prior to the Mass, his choir will have had only three weeks of rehearsals.</p><p>“It really puts the responsibility on us to prove what kinds of musicians we are,” Nestor said. “Having a beautiful voice is important, but if you can’t pick up this piece of music and sing it beautifully the first time then we are not doing our job as professors. Those who are performing at this Mass, a single sophomore through senior doctoral students, alumnae and faculty, are among our very finest.”</p><p>Among the pieces to be performed during Wednesday’s Mass are three compositions by Nestor, including the introit, the communion antiphon, and an original work that will be performed during the communion rite, “I Am the Living Bread.”</p><p>“It’s the fourth time I’ve been commissioned to write for the Holy Father when he has come to the United States,” said Nestor. Previously he has composed pieces for Pope John Paul II’s visits to Los Angeles in 1984 and to St. Louis in 1999, as well as Pope Benedict XVI’s visit to Washington, D.C., in 2008.</p><p>“We could not be more honored,” Nestor said, adding that CUA musicians are most moved to join with Pope Francis in celebrating the Eucharist. “He’s coming to break bread with us, to preside at the Eucharist, which is what Jesus Christ commanded us to do every day of our lives. It’s both durable and exceptional.”</p><p>Tartaglione also said he is “extremely honored and fortunate” to have a part in the papal Mass.</p><div

After living in Rome for so many years, it’s really very emotional in many way bringing together my past, present and future. For me as a Catholic he is an inspiration in our daily life on how relate to others and try to make the world a better place for all.” he said. “I’m sharing all my passion and knowledge with the players so to work together making everything sound as beautiful as the importance of the event and Pope Francis deserves.&#8221;</p><p>Prior to the papal Mass, the orchestra will give two concerts for the clients of the interfaith community-based organization SOME (So Others Might Eat) on Saturday, Sept. 19. Concerts will take place at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. and will include pieces to be performed during the canonization Mass, including Mendelssohn’s Italian Symphony No. 4, first movement, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5, fourth movement.</p><p>“Performing in that setting will be thought provoking for us and helpful to the persons using the facility,” Tartaglione said. “I thought it was a nice gesture to bring what we are doing for the most important person in the Catholic religion to people who may not be the first priority in society.”</p><p>&gt; <a

On April 12, 2014, Minnich attended a papal audience for members of the committee. He said to the Holy Father in Italian, “May the Lord help you to continue the good work!” The Pope responded, “Let us pray!”</p><p>Minnich dedicated the centennial issue of the <em>Catholic Historical Review</em> to Pope Francis and sent him a personal copy with an attached letter. Pope Francis (through his secretary) responded to Minnich, saying “His Holiness assures you and your associates of a special remembrance in his prayers. It is his hope that the fine tradition of scholarship reflected in the pages of the Centennial Issue will continue to inspire your service to the Church’s growth in understanding of her rich spiritual history.”</p><p><em>Are you a CUA student, faculty, or staff member who has encountered Pope Francis?

He is the common father of all the members of God’s family on this earth, of all who are united to Christ’s Church either visibly (through baptism and a shared profession or faith) or invisibly (through charity and a sincere quest to seek the truth and live in accordance with it).</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Melissa Moschella</p></div><p>A pope’s visit is always an extraordinary moment of grace, a time in which God touches the hearts of people in a special way, leading some to return like the prodigal son and be welcomed anew into their Father’s house, sparking in others a new and deeper conversion; illuminating some to discover their particular vocation in life, strengthening others on the path of joyful fidelity to their calling. And for the nation as a whole, a papal visit is an opportunity for spiritual growth and renewal, an impetus to take concrete steps in order to bring our laws and culture more closely into line with the demands of human dignity.</p><p>One of the reasons why see such extraordinary grace at work during a papal visit is that millions of people around the world are united in prayer for this special intention. Now that the Pope’s arrival is imminent, we can each ask ourselves: How am I contributing to the fruitfulness of the Pope’s visit through my own prayer and sacrifice? How am I preparing my own heart to respond to the graces that God wants shower upon me during this time?</p><p>We don’t need to do extraordinary things: Perhaps we can challenge ourselves to spend a few minutes each day in prayerful conversation with God or meditation on the Scriptures, offering this time (and the sacrifice involved in carving out those moments of quiet time in our busy schedule) for Pope Francis and the fruits of his visit. Perhaps we can resolve to be more diligent in a particular aspect of our work or studies, offering that effort to God for this intention. Perhaps we can find concrete ways to treat the others around us with greater kindness and respect, offering a sympathetic ear to someone whose conversation we find a bit tiresome, smiling and being courteous to family members, roommates or colleagues even if we’re tired or having a hard day. … The possibilities are endless!</p><p>These, and many other small resolutions that we might make to live out our calling as Christians with greater joy and fidelity, are the kinds of things that Pope Francis has been exhorting each of us to do in his homilies, audiences, speeches, and writings. They may seem small, but so is the bit of leaven that enables the whole loaf of bread to rise, or the pinch of salt that gives flavor to a meal. These are all ways in which we can strive to walk with Francis, supporting his efforts to bring the Good News to the people of Cuba and the United States, and preparing our own hearts for the blessings that God wants to send us.</p><p>— <em><a

As they watch the Holy Father on the East Portico of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, they will be treated to a beautiful backdrop.</p><p>Towering behind the outdoor papal altar that was specially designed by CUA architecture and planning students will be the largest Catholic Church in North America and one of the 10 largest churches in the world. The cross atop the Great Dome of the Basilica will rise 237 feet above the pontiff. The dome, made of blue and yellow polychrome tiles and 108-feet in diameter, will provide a beautiful background image for attendees’ photos, as well as their memories.</p><p>When Pope Francis looks out at the congregation he will have an impressive view of his own — the landscape and architecture of the largest and greenest college campus in Washington, D.C. Framing the Mall, he will see some of the University’s most historic, grand buildings such as the Collegiate, Gothic-style Father O’Connell Hall (built in 1914) and Gibbons Hall (built in 1911) and the Romanesque-style McMahon Hall (built in 1892).</p><p>To anyone witnessing this historic moment there will be no divide between the University and the Basilica. The historic outdoor papal Mass will take place in one spectacular location.</p><p>The Basilica, once part of the University, is now a separate entity. But the two Catholic institutions share a close and seamless relationship. “The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception is integral to our University community,” says President John Garvey.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">The Annual Christmas Concert for Charity at the Basilica.</p></div><p>“It not only adds to the beauty of our campus, but to our faith life as well. From regular Sunday worship in the lower Crypt Church to our University-wide Mass of the Holy Spirit in the Great Upper Church that marks the beginning of our academic year to our annual Commencement ceremonies, the Basilica is the setting for many of the University’s most important moments,” says Garvey.</p><p>With support from Pope Pius X in 1913, Bishop Thomas J. Shahan, the fourth rector of Catholic University, launched a fundraising campaign that culminated in the laying of the cornerstone of a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary on Sept. 23, 1920. The first Mass was held in the national shrine on Easter Sunday 1924. The Crypt Church was completed in 1926. The Great Depression and World War II put construction of the Great Upper Church superstructure on hold. The national shrine incorporated separately from the University in 1948. Construction resumed in 1954 and was completed in 1959.</p><p>“Since the inception of the Shrine, the University and the National Shrine have been intimately involved, especially regarding the spiritual life of the University,” says Monsignor Walter R. Rossi, Basilica rector. “To this day we continue to collaborate with annual events such as the Christmas Concert for Charity, student convocations, the Mass of the Holy Spirit, and Commencement exercises. Working together now in preparation for the visit of Pope Francis seems like a natural extension of our many joint events which are always a positive, effortless experience thanks to the wonderful cooperation of President Garvey, Frank Persico [vice president for University relations and chief of staff], and the entire President’s office.”</p><p>“It would be hard to imagine the University without the Basilica,” adds Garvey. “We are fortunate to share such a strong relationship with ‘America’s Catholic Church’ and its staff.”</p><p><em>As the University and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception prepare to host Pope Francis during his historic visit to the United States, members of the University community share what the Basilica means to them. </em></p><p><strong>Leo Nestor</strong><br
/> <strong>Justine Bayard Ward Professor, director of the Institute of Sacred Music at CUA</strong><br
/> <strong>Conductor for CUA Chamber Choir and Symphony Orchestra at Papal Mass</strong><br
/> <strong>Benjamin T. Rome School of Music</strong></p><p>When in 1913 the Board of Trustees of The Catholic University of America donated land at the southwest corner of campus for the construction of a national shrine to honor Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception, who would have imagined that Bishop Shahan’s vision of a “monument of love and gratitude, a great hymn in stone” would keep that corner parcel of land and its eventual basilica so close to the CUA community?</p><p>Far greater than merely a beautiful place for our occasional concerts and convocations, it has from its inception been our spiritual oasis. There the University celebrates major liturgies in the Great Upper Church at which our chancellor Donald Cardinal Wuerl often presides. There students, faculty, and staff attend daily and Sunday Masses, regularly availing themselves of the Sacrament of Reconciliation in the Crypt Church, the very heart of the Basilica.</p><p>In this holy subterranean church evocative of the catacombs, the University community celebrates Eucharist each Sunday of the academic year at 4 p.m. While the Crypt Church with its noble acoustic and tracker organ provide an intimate space for music making, the expanse of the Great Upper Church has become the locus for our annual Christmas Concert for Charity in tandem with the Basilica musicians, which in December celebrates its 26<sup>th</sup> year.</p><p>On the East Portico of the Basilica on Sept. 23, Pope Francis will celebrate the Mass of canonization of Fray Junípero Serra, apostle of California, at which the CUA Chamber Choir and Symphony Orchestra will join with many other musicians from throughout the Archdiocese of Washington. Though it is not a parish and is shared with all who come to pray, worship, and confess there, the Basilica is and has always been integral to the spiritual and liturgical life of the University.</p><p><strong>Victor David, B.A. 2014<br
/> Altar server</strong></p><p>I feel that being at the Basilica, both as a student and now as an alumnus of CUA, represents several things. It represented the beginning of my time at CUA when I attended the Mass during Orientation. Then it represented an end as I received my diploma on the east steps during Commencement. And because of my sustained involvement with the Basilica, it represents a continued relationship with both CUA and my faith life. In all these things, the Basilica has been a home, both spiritually and physically — I can’t help but feel at peace whenever I am there.</p><p>Serving at a Mass in the Basilica still fills me with great emotion even after having done so for almost five years. Being near the altar, looking out at the congregation, and reflecting on all the beautiful sacred art have truly helped me grow in my faith journey. For me, there is no greater honor as a young layman than to assist the priest in his role to bring Christ to others in the Eucharist. Though sometimes it can be a bit hectic when serving or as a master of ceremonies (the head server) at any given Mass, I can always find solace in the fact that what I am doing is helping others on their journey of faith. And to do that in a place as magnificent as the Basilica, I can’t help but count it as one of the great blessings in my life.</p><p><strong>Ajani Gibson, B.A. 2015</strong><br
/> <strong>Assistant to the Basilica’s director of liturgy</strong></p><p>I am responsible for coordinating all the priests who say Mass and hear confessions at the Basilica. I also coordinate the 300 liturgical volunteers who assist at the various Masses at the Basilica throughout the year. During my undergrad years, I was one of the regular masters of ceremonies for the Basilica.</p><p>It is a special place. The unique nature of the Basilica is not limited to its size or grandeur; rather, it is found in how the Basilica becomes a home to thousands of pilgrims and many CUA students. You are able to find yourself reflected in the many chapels. For example, my favorite chapel is the Mary, Mother of Africa, Chapel. In it is this beautifully carved mahogany crucifix, which is similar to a crucifix in my home parish in New Orleans. For someone coming from so far and being able to have something I could connect with from home makes the Basilica a safe haven. I think by having it adjacent to campus, we, as a university, are constantly reminded of our responsibility as The Catholic University of America to set the standard for Catholic life for young adults and our responsibility to share the Catholic faith with our country.</p><p><strong>Rev. Justin Ross, O.F.M. Conv.</strong><strong><br
/> Associate chaplain for liturgy and worship</strong><br
/> <strong> CUA Office of Campus Ministry</strong></p><p>This time of year, you will see students posting photos of themselves, standing in front of the Basilica, to Instagram. Their message is “I’m back home!” For so many students, the Basilica is part of their home and their community at CUA.</p><p>And that is perhaps most apparent in their dedication to the 4 p.m. Sunday Mass held during the school year. It is one of three student Masses held each Sunday; the other two are held in campus chapels, one in the morning and one in the evening. They each have a different feel to them. The Crypt Church Mass has a feeling of grandiosity because of the space and the sacred music, yet it’s intimate. The students are readers, servers, Eucharistic ministers, liturgical ministers, choir members, and organ players. It is their Mass, and they are ever appreciative that they have this beautiful sacred space in which to worship.</p><p>If you look at the origins of the Basilica, it was conceived as a chapel for Catholic University, which in its early days had already outgrown its small and only chapel in Caldwell Hall. And even though the Basilica has grown into the national church of the Catholic Church in America, it remains a place of worship and spirituality for our students. Our relationship with the Basilica remains strong and it is because of the generosity of its leaders that students can continue to call it part of their campus home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/the-basilica-and-cua-a-seamless-relationship/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Students Challenged to #WalkwithFrancis at Mass of the Holy Spirit</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/students-challenged-to-walkwithfrancis-at-mass-of-the-holy-spirit/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/students-challenged-to-walkwithfrancis-at-mass-of-the-holy-spirit/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2015 13:44:34 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Katie Bahr]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[News]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Walk with Francis]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Academic Events]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Campus Ministry]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Cardinal Donald Wuerl]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Church]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Eucharist]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Faculty]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Mass]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Mass of the Holy Spirit]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Pray]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Prayer]]></category> <category><![CDATA[President John Garvey]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Serve]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Students]]></category> <category><![CDATA[walkwithfrancis]]></category><guid

We are challenged to take the love and mercy of God and share it with others.”</p><p>The cardinal encouraged students to use this upcoming academic year to continue spiritual formation and to ask God’s help in living their faith.</p><p>“Here at this university, in addition to preparing for a job and a means to a paycheck, we should also accept that we have a deeper calling — to do our part to help make the world just a little better,” he said. “We come together to ask for the gifts of the Holy Spirit because we dare to believe we really can make a difference. We are capable of renewing the face of the earth, or at least trying — at least, doing our part with the help of God.”</p><p>Following the homily, Cardinal Wuerl conferred the Canonical Mission — the authorization to teach in the name of the Church — to William Daniel of the School of Canon Law.</p><p>In his remarks after Mass, University President John Garvey advised students to live the virtue of constancy in their academic, spiritual, and personal lives.</p><div

It is the virtue that gives you the conviction to opt-out of the hookup culture, because you are a child of God made for love far greater than that.”</p><p>Garvey encouraged students to follow Pope Francis’s example of constancy by taking small, concrete steps to follow Christ. Garvey encouraged students to participate in the Archdiocese of Washington’s #WalkwithFrancis initiative by making concrete commitments to pray, serve, and act. Garvey also pledged to participate in the initiative and said he would serve at the Little Sisters of the Poor in Brookland.</p><p>“If we call ourselves Christians, we must affirm that fact in our actions,” Garvey said. “This is constancy.”</p><p>Following Mass, all students who pledged to participate in the initiative received blue wristbands marked #WalkwithFrancis. In his closing remarks, Cardinal Wuerl noted that if everyone wears the bracelets during the papal Mass on Sept. 23, it will be a visual reminder of the University’s commitment to service and prayer.</p><p><iframe

In October 2013 the council had a private audience with the Holy Father. The Grabowskis were the first couple selected to come forward and greet him (though the Pope would eventually greet everyone in the room). When he had the opportunity to do so, Grabowski, asked the Pope to pray for Claire, as she had been in the hospital the month before.</p><p>“Without hesitation, Pope Francis placed his hand on Claire&#8217;s head and prayed over her,” John says. “It was an unexpected but wonderful gesture, which made the meeting even more memorable.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/encountering-pope-francis-john-grabowski/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
