Before the press conference began, reporters got to witness staff members from the Office of Facilities Maintenance and Operations remove a light pole that stood in the way of the view of the East Portico of the Shrine.</p><p>Catholic University President John Garvey; Cardinal Donald Wuerl, archbishop of Washington and University chancellor; and Monsignor Walter Rossi, rector of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, took a brief tour of the work underway on the Shrine, including a close-up inspection of the roof and stage that will be the visual centerpiece of next week’s Mass.</p><p>During the press conference, President Garvey, Monsignor Rossi, and Cardinal Wuerl all noted the work three <a

On Wednesday, workers employed by Showcall Inc., an events production company, assembled a 10-level riser between Shahan and McGivney halls that will accommodate more than 350 members of the media. Work continued on the stage and roof  being built on the east steps of the Basilica. Students and faculty navigated around tall perimeter fencing and interior &#8220;bike rack&#8221; barriers on their way to and from classes while forklifts carrying construction materials zipped around the work sites.</p><p>Over the next six days, workers will also install a riser for the choir and large LED video walls near the stage. The University Mall will be divided into sections for seated and standing ticket holders. A vending area for food and religious goods will be set up on St. Thomas Hill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div
