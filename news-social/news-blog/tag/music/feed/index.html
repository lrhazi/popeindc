The massive congregation gathered on the University Mall, in crowds that spread from the front of the Basilica to Mullen Library and beyond.</p><p>Pope Francis began his homily with a message of joy.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Deacons, accompanied by student volunteers, process to Mass in order to distribute communion.</p></div><p>“Rejoice in the Lord always,” he said. “I’ll say it again: Rejoice in the Lord always.”</p><p>Rather than settling for earthly pleasures and “things that are comfortable,” the Pope told the massive congregation to avoid falling into apathy, “a habit with a fatal consequence: our hearts go numb.”</p><p>Continuing, the Pope said Christians should live out their joyful faith by proclaiming the Gospel to the entire world — going out “to the highways” — and sharing the good news without judgment or condescension.</p><p>“Jesus would not provide a short list of who is or who is not worthy of receiving his presence,” Pope Francis said.</p><p>Pope Francis also spoke highly of St. Junípero, calling him “the embodiment of a church which goes forth.” He said people should follow in his example by following the new saint’s motto in life: “Siempre Adelante,” which translates to “Keep moving forward.”</p><p>The Mass, which was celebrated in Spanish, was intended to shine a light on the diverse Catholic community in the United States and the Washington Metropolitan Area. The program included readings in English and the Native American Chochenyo language. Following the Homily, a Universal Prayer included lines read in Korean, American Sign Language, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Igbo, and Creole.</p><div

The orchestra performed under the direction of Simeone Tartaglione, the orchestra’s music director, while the chamber choir was conducted by Leo Nestor, Justine Bayard Ward Professor and director of choral studies and CUA’s Institute of Sacred Music.</p><p>Several alumni and faculty members composed original works for the visit, including Nestor. Nestor’s compositions for the Mass included the introit, the communion antiphon, and an original work, “I am the Living Bread,” that was performed during the communion rite.</p><p>Following the Holy Eucharist, which was distributed by more than 200 deacons accompanied by student volunteers, Cardinal Donald Wuerl gave a short address to the Pope and those in attendance.</p><p>“Not far from here in 1634, the first Catholics arrived in what is now the United States and began the evangelization effort that we see so wonderfully realized today at this great Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and the campus of The Catholic University of America,” Cardinal Wuerl said.</p><p>“As we seek today to enrich our human culture with the great love — love of God and love of neighbor, we also try to care for our common home, the good earth,” he continued. “We take seriously your call in <em>Laudato Sí</em> to face the challenges of our day and to do so with respect for the dignity of each person; concern for one another, especially the marginalized and the poor; and care for the good earth, God’s gift to us now and for generations to come.”</p><p>Thanking the Holy Father for visiting the University and the United States, Cardinal Wuerl continued:  “We look to you, Holy Father, for renewed inspiration so that we might truly be evangelizers.”</p><p>&gt; <a

class="wp-caption-text">Members of the CUA Symphony Orchestra are seen in Ward Hall hours before the Papal Mass.</p></div><p>“It’s such an amazing experience,” she said. “It still hasn’t quite hit me how big of a deal this is. I think my brain knows it, but I don’t know if I’m going to really understand it for a little while.”</p><p>DeGeorgia was also excited that the Pope would come to her own University campus.</p><p>“It’s so special for the people who are here right now,” she said. “As musicians, our goal for today is to glorify God through the gifts we’ve been given.”</p><p>Christine Laird, a master’s student and member of the chamber choir, was walking toward Ward Hall at the same time. She said she also had a hard time comprehending what the day would be like.</p><p>“We’ve been rehearsing for several weeks, but I don’t think we quite get the magnitude of it,” she said. “I don&#8217;t think it will be until it’s all put together, when all the people are here, that we will finally understand and see what we are singing for. It’s going to be really overwhelming.”</p><p>Downstairs in Ward Hall, a trio of brass players were retrieving their instruments and warming up in the piano lab.</p><p>Junior Matthew Fitzsimmons, a trumpet player, said he felt honored and excited to be playing a role in today’s papal Mass.</p><p>“It’s hard to believe that it’s actually happening,” he said. “I’ve never been part of something this big. It’s a huge honor.”</p><p>Freshman Christopher Gillie, a french horn player, was also warming up before the Mass, which more than 25,000 people are expected to attend.</p><p>“This is definitely nerve-wracking,” he said. “This is the largest audience I’ll probably ever play for — probably the largest audience anyone here will ever play for.”</p><p>Having only started college a month ago, Gillie said the rehearsals for the papal Mass were a great way to meet other students, alumni, and local musicians.</p><p>“I didn’t know I’d have this opportunity,” he said. “It’s a pretty cool way to start my college career.”</p><p>Faculty member Eric Moore, who teaches french horn, was also eagerly awaiting the day’s Mass. A former member of the U.S. Navy Band, Moore said he has played for presidents and other government officials in the past, but that playing for a pope is unique.</p><p>“I came up here on the Metro and saw people who have come from long distances for this,” Moore said. “As a musician, this is different. It’s not like playing for a military or political figure. This is something bigger than that and more inspiring than that.”</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/university-musicians-our-goal-is-to-glorify-god/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Campus Filled With Activity the Day Before Papal Visit</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/campus-filled-with-activity-the-day-before-papal-visit/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/campus-filled-with-activity-the-day-before-papal-visit/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2015 20:29:57 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Katie Bahr]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[News]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Pope at CUA]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Preparing for the Pope]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Alumni]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Basilica]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Faculty]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Media]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Music]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Preparations]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Students]]></category><guid

Mullen of Denver Library. Faculty experts have been speaking with the media, including President John Garvey, who joined reporter Lester Holt from NBC Nightly News for an interview on the roof of O’Connell Hall.</p><p>The liturgical committee is in high gear at the Basilica, preparing the altar, hanging the crucifix, and preparing tens of thousands of communion wafers — including a low-gluten variety — for tomorrow’s Mass.</p><p>Elsewhere on campus, students are navigating new routes as they walk between classes, which are still in session. In addition to the large number of bike racks put in place earlier this month for security reasons, students now face new obstacles: rows of porta-potties, ATMs, and quickly constructed food and souvenir stands.</p><p>Many students have been finding time during the day to investigate the scene on the University Mall, where 15,000 seats have been set up and numbered in preparation for the canonization Mass.</p><div

Pryzbyla University Center, where the office of Jon Sawyer, associate vice president for student affairs and the dean of students, was distributing 700 tickets for students to view the Pope’s address to a joint meeting of Congress from the West Front of the Capital. The tickets were awarded to the University from the House of Representatives.</p><p>Freshman Briana Marcinauskis was among the students who received a ticket to the Capital.</p><p>“I was going back and forth (on whether I wanted the tickets) because I know I’m going to be so tired, but then I thought, ‘It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she said. “I got down (to the Pryzbyla Center) and they had five left so I grabbed two of them.”</p><p>Walking around campus the day before Pope Francis’s visit is “a little overwhelming,” Marcinauskis said. “Hearing all the music all day has been crazy, but people are really excited.”</p><p><iframe

But on Saturday, Sept. 19, the orchestra performed for a significantly different audience: the clients of the interfaith community-based organization SOME (So Others Might Eat).</p><p>As a nonprofit, SOME provides food and support to the poor and homeless in Washington, D.C. According to the organization’s website, there are 7,298 homeless men, women, and children living in D.C. SOME serves them by offering affordable housing, job training, addiction treatment, and mental health counseling.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Members of the Symphony Orchestra perform at SOME (So Others Might Eat) Sept. 19.</p></div><p>On Saturday, the orchestra performed two pieces for the clients in the SOME dining room, as clients were eating lunches of chicken and rice. Works performed included Mendelssohn’s Italian Symphony No. 4, first movement, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5, fourth movement.</p><p>University faculty Simeone Tartaglione, director of the orchestra, said the event was intended to help students prepare spiritually for the papal visit.<br
/> “Pope Francis is really an inspiration for us,” Tartaglione said. “He inspired us to bring the pieces we’re going to do for him to the people who won’t be there.</p><p>“As a Catholic institution, we should remind our students that life has different conditions and that it’s not a matter of fault or guilt,” he said. “This is something we can do. We can be a sign, plant a seed in somebody maybe to help them look for something better.”</p><p>Violinist Shinya Blattmann, who is pursuing her master’s degree in performance, said she is thrilled at the opportunity to play during Wednesday’s papal Mass.<br
/> “I think it’s going to be a highlight of my life,” she said.</p><p>For her, playing at SOME was a good reminder of her own blessings.</p><p>“We can go to the Kennedy Center or to a concert anytime we want, but they can’t do that,” she said. “It’s nice to play for them and to see them happy.”</p><p>Likewise, violinist Aurora Wheeland, a student in the school of law, said she was happy to bring classical music to people who may not ordinarily have access.</p><p>“A lot of times, people think of classical music as kind of an elitist thing, but it’s meant to be shared with everybody,” she said. “I find that everybody can respond to classical music, whether it’s their favorite kind of music or they’ve never been exposed to it before. It’s really powerful.”</p><p>David Peterson, a first-year doctoral student in conducting, will be one of the cover conductors for Wednesday’s papal Mass. He said the concert at SOME was a way for the musicians to connect with those in need in the local community.</p><p>“If we can give this music to people and even one person can dream for half an hour, then it’s worth it for me,” he said. “Everyone is here because they want to be here. Our call time this morning was 10 a.m. and people were at the School of Music at 9:30 ready to go.”</p><p>David Bond, who is earning his master’s in conducting, has been working as the manager of the orchestra in preparation for the papal Mass. Over the past few weeks, he said he has enjoyed making arrangements and seeing the alumni who have come back to play in the orchestra. He said the concert at SOME was a good opportunity for the musicians to share their gifts with those in need.</p><p>“These people need food of course, but I think they also need beauty and art and music in their lives,” he said. “The Pope is so invested in the lives of the lowest of the low and in my opinion, playing beautiful music is a way to help them that is right up there with feeding them. Everyone has their gift to give.”</p><p><iframe

class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Leo Nestor, conductor of the University Chamber Choir, leads a rehearsal in Ward Hall.</p></div><p>“Even with the limited number of rehearsals we had, everyone stepped up to the challenge and prepared for a wonderful performance, inspired by the shining personality of Pope Francis,” said Tartaglione.</p><p>Professor Leo Nestor, who will be conducting the orchestra and chamber choir of 28 singers during the Mass, said he is looking forward to Wednesday’s papal Mass. Prior to the Mass, his choir will have had only three weeks of rehearsals.</p><p>“It really puts the responsibility on us to prove what kinds of musicians we are,” Nestor said. “Having a beautiful voice is important, but if you can’t pick up this piece of music and sing it beautifully the first time then we are not doing our job as professors. Those who are performing at this Mass, a single sophomore through senior doctoral students, alumnae and faculty, are among our very finest.”</p><p>Among the pieces to be performed during Wednesday’s Mass are three compositions by Nestor, including the introit, the communion antiphon, and an original work that will be performed during the communion rite, “I Am the Living Bread.”</p><p>“It’s the fourth time I’ve been commissioned to write for the Holy Father when he has come to the United States,” said Nestor. Previously he has composed pieces for Pope John Paul II’s visits to Los Angeles in 1984 and to St. Louis in 1999, as well as Pope Benedict XVI’s visit to Washington, D.C., in 2008.</p><p>“We could not be more honored,” Nestor said, adding that CUA musicians are most moved to join with Pope Francis in celebrating the Eucharist. “He’s coming to break bread with us, to preside at the Eucharist, which is what Jesus Christ commanded us to do every day of our lives. It’s both durable and exceptional.”</p><p>Tartaglione also said he is “extremely honored and fortunate” to have a part in the papal Mass.</p><div

After living in Rome for so many years, it’s really very emotional in many way bringing together my past, present and future. For me as a Catholic he is an inspiration in our daily life on how relate to others and try to make the world a better place for all.” he said. “I’m sharing all my passion and knowledge with the players so to work together making everything sound as beautiful as the importance of the event and Pope Francis deserves.&#8221;</p><p>Prior to the papal Mass, the orchestra will give two concerts for the clients of the interfaith community-based organization SOME (So Others Might Eat) on Saturday, Sept. 19. Concerts will take place at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. and will include pieces to be performed during the canonization Mass, including Mendelssohn’s Italian Symphony No. 4, first movement, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5, fourth movement.</p><p>“Performing in that setting will be thought provoking for us and helpful to the persons using the facility,” Tartaglione said. “I thought it was a nice gesture to bring what we are doing for the most important person in the Catholic religion to people who may not be the first priority in society.”</p><p>&gt; <a

Rome School of Music will be among the talented local musicians providing music as the Pope celebrates the canonization Mass of Blessed Junípero Serra this September at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.</p><p>The Sept. 23 Mass will include performances by the CUA Symphony Orchestra as well as five local choirs, including the Catholic University Chamber Choir. The orchestra will perform under the direction of Simeone Tartaglione, the orchestra’s music director. The Chamber Choir will be conducted by Leo Nestor, Justine Bayard Ward Professor and director of choral studies and CUA’s Institute of Sacred Music.</p><p>Additionally, several alumni and faculty members have composed original works for the visit, including Nestor. Nestor’s compositions for the Mass include the introit, the communion antiphon, and an original work that will be performed during the communion rite.</p><p>Thomas Stehle, director of music ministries for the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, is head of planning of music for the papal visit. In total, he said there will be 240 singers performing during the canonization Mass. The other choirs to perform include the Choir of the Basilica, a gospel choir, an intercultural choir, an auditioned archdiocesan choir. The Washington Symphonic Brass will also perform.</p><p>Prior to Mass, there will be 75 minutes of prelude music in which each choir as well as the CUA Orchestra will perform individually and together.</p><p>Stehle said the music chosen for the Mass will represent the life of Junípero Serra, the legacy of St. Francis of Assisi, and the diversity of cultures represented in Washington and throughout the United States. Though the principal language of the Mass is Spanish, many other languages and cultures will also be represented, including French, English, Latin, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Xhosa (the language sometimes called Afrikaans).</p><p>Grayson Wagstaff, dean of the School of Music and director of the Latin American Music Center, noted the importance of CUA students performing music by Manuel de Zumaya, whom he called “one of the greatest composers of Colonial Mexico.”</p><p>“This beautiful Spanish texted music for the Catholic office liturgy of Matins is the kind of music that Serra would have heard when he travelled to Mexico City and then may have brought with him to California while founding missions,” Wagstaff said. “Few other universities in the United States regularly perform works of this kind.”</p><p>“The idea is that people experiencing this Mass, no matter where they’re from, can be both connected to the Universal church and recognize that the voice and culture they bring is also represented here,” said Stehle. “Something about hearing from different cultures reminds us that we’re not one thing. Even though we are united in Christ, we have many faces, many hues, many languages, and many musical expressions that make up this one body.”</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/cua-musicians-to-perform-during-canonization-mass/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
