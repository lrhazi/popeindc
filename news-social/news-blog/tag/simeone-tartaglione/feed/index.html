But on Saturday, Sept. 19, the orchestra performed for a significantly different audience: the clients of the interfaith community-based organization SOME (So Others Might Eat).</p><p>As a nonprofit, SOME provides food and support to the poor and homeless in Washington, D.C. According to the organization’s website, there are 7,298 homeless men, women, and children living in D.C. SOME serves them by offering affordable housing, job training, addiction treatment, and mental health counseling.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Members of the Symphony Orchestra perform at SOME (So Others Might Eat) Sept. 19.</p></div><p>On Saturday, the orchestra performed two pieces for the clients in the SOME dining room, as clients were eating lunches of chicken and rice. Works performed included Mendelssohn’s Italian Symphony No. 4, first movement, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5, fourth movement.</p><p>University faculty Simeone Tartaglione, director of the orchestra, said the event was intended to help students prepare spiritually for the papal visit.<br
/> “Pope Francis is really an inspiration for us,” Tartaglione said. “He inspired us to bring the pieces we’re going to do for him to the people who won’t be there.</p><p>“As a Catholic institution, we should remind our students that life has different conditions and that it’s not a matter of fault or guilt,” he said. “This is something we can do. We can be a sign, plant a seed in somebody maybe to help them look for something better.”</p><p>Violinist Shinya Blattmann, who is pursuing her master’s degree in performance, said she is thrilled at the opportunity to play during Wednesday’s papal Mass.<br
/> “I think it’s going to be a highlight of my life,” she said.</p><p>For her, playing at SOME was a good reminder of her own blessings.</p><p>“We can go to the Kennedy Center or to a concert anytime we want, but they can’t do that,” she said. “It’s nice to play for them and to see them happy.”</p><p>Likewise, violinist Aurora Wheeland, a student in the school of law, said she was happy to bring classical music to people who may not ordinarily have access.</p><p>“A lot of times, people think of classical music as kind of an elitist thing, but it’s meant to be shared with everybody,” she said. “I find that everybody can respond to classical music, whether it’s their favorite kind of music or they’ve never been exposed to it before. It’s really powerful.”</p><p>David Peterson, a first-year doctoral student in conducting, will be one of the cover conductors for Wednesday’s papal Mass. He said the concert at SOME was a way for the musicians to connect with those in need in the local community.</p><p>“If we can give this music to people and even one person can dream for half an hour, then it’s worth it for me,” he said. “Everyone is here because they want to be here. Our call time this morning was 10 a.m. and people were at the School of Music at 9:30 ready to go.”</p><p>David Bond, who is earning his master’s in conducting, has been working as the manager of the orchestra in preparation for the papal Mass. Over the past few weeks, he said he has enjoyed making arrangements and seeing the alumni who have come back to play in the orchestra. He said the concert at SOME was a good opportunity for the musicians to share their gifts with those in need.</p><p>“These people need food of course, but I think they also need beauty and art and music in their lives,” he said. “The Pope is so invested in the lives of the lowest of the low and in my opinion, playing beautiful music is a way to help them that is right up there with feeding them. Everyone has their gift to give.”</p><p><iframe

Rome School of Music gathered in Ward Hall Thursday for a joint rehearsal of the repertoire to be performed during next week’s papal Mass.

class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Leo Nestor, conductor of the University Chamber Choir, leads a rehearsal in Ward Hall.</p></div><p>“Even with the limited number of rehearsals we had, everyone stepped up to the challenge and prepared for a wonderful performance, inspired by the shining personality of Pope Francis,” said Tartaglione.</p><p>Professor Leo Nestor, who will be conducting the orchestra and chamber choir of 28 singers during the Mass, said he is looking forward to Wednesday’s papal Mass. Prior to the Mass, his choir will have had only three weeks of rehearsals.</p><p>“It really puts the responsibility on us to prove what kinds of musicians we are,” Nestor said. “Having a beautiful voice is important, but if you can’t pick up this piece of music and sing it beautifully the first time then we are not doing our job as professors. Those who are performing at this Mass, a single sophomore through senior doctoral students, alumnae and faculty, are among our very finest.”</p><p>Among the pieces to be performed during Wednesday’s Mass are three compositions by Nestor, including the introit, the communion antiphon, and an original work that will be performed during the communion rite, “I Am the Living Bread.”</p><p>“It’s the fourth time I’ve been commissioned to write for the Holy Father when he has come to the United States,” said Nestor. Previously he has composed pieces for Pope John Paul II’s visits to Los Angeles in 1984 and to St. Louis in 1999, as well as Pope Benedict XVI’s visit to Washington, D.C., in 2008.</p><p>“We could not be more honored,” Nestor said, adding that CUA musicians are most moved to join with Pope Francis in celebrating the Eucharist. “He’s coming to break bread with us, to preside at the Eucharist, which is what Jesus Christ commanded us to do every day of our lives. It’s both durable and exceptional.”</p><p>Tartaglione also said he is “extremely honored and fortunate” to have a part in the papal Mass.</p><div

After living in Rome for so many years, it’s really very emotional in many way bringing together my past, present and future. For me as a Catholic he is an inspiration in our daily life on how relate to others and try to make the world a better place for all.” he said. “I’m sharing all my passion and knowledge with the players so to work together making everything sound as beautiful as the importance of the event and Pope Francis deserves.&#8221;</p><p>Prior to the papal Mass, the orchestra will give two concerts for the clients of the interfaith community-based organization SOME (So Others Might Eat) on Saturday, Sept. 19. Concerts will take place at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. and will include pieces to be performed during the canonization Mass, including Mendelssohn’s Italian Symphony No. 4, first movement, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5, fourth movement.</p><p>“Performing in that setting will be thought provoking for us and helpful to the persons using the facility,” Tartaglione said. “I thought it was a nice gesture to bring what we are doing for the most important person in the Catholic religion to people who may not be the first priority in society.”</p><p>&gt; <a

Rome School of Music will be among the talented local musicians providing music as the Pope celebrates the canonization Mass of Blessed Junípero Serra this September at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.</p><p>The Sept. 23 Mass will include performances by the CUA Symphony Orchestra as well as five local choirs, including the Catholic University Chamber Choir. The orchestra will perform under the direction of Simeone Tartaglione, the orchestra’s music director. The Chamber Choir will be conducted by Leo Nestor, Justine Bayard Ward Professor and director of choral studies and CUA’s Institute of Sacred Music.</p><p>Additionally, several alumni and faculty members have composed original works for the visit, including Nestor. Nestor’s compositions for the Mass include the introit, the communion antiphon, and an original work that will be performed during the communion rite.</p><p>Thomas Stehle, director of music ministries for the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, is head of planning of music for the papal visit. In total, he said there will be 240 singers performing during the canonization Mass. The other choirs to perform include the Choir of the Basilica, a gospel choir, an intercultural choir, an auditioned archdiocesan choir. The Washington Symphonic Brass will also perform.</p><p>Prior to Mass, there will be 75 minutes of prelude music in which each choir as well as the CUA Orchestra will perform individually and together.</p><p>Stehle said the music chosen for the Mass will represent the life of Junípero Serra, the legacy of St. Francis of Assisi, and the diversity of cultures represented in Washington and throughout the United States. Though the principal language of the Mass is Spanish, many other languages and cultures will also be represented, including French, English, Latin, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Xhosa (the language sometimes called Afrikaans).</p><p>Grayson Wagstaff, dean of the School of Music and director of the Latin American Music Center, noted the importance of CUA students performing music by Manuel de Zumaya, whom he called “one of the greatest composers of Colonial Mexico.”</p><p>“This beautiful Spanish texted music for the Catholic office liturgy of Matins is the kind of music that Serra would have heard when he travelled to Mexico City and then may have brought with him to California while founding missions,” Wagstaff said. “Few other universities in the United States regularly perform works of this kind.”</p><p>“The idea is that people experiencing this Mass, no matter where they’re from, can be both connected to the Universal church and recognize that the voice and culture they bring is also represented here,” said Stehle. “Something about hearing from different cultures reminds us that we’re not one thing. Even though we are united in Christ, we have many faces, many hues, many languages, and many musical expressions that make up this one body.”</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/cua-musicians-to-perform-during-canonization-mass/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
