href="http://ministry.cua.edu/retreat/freshman.cfm">freshmen retreat</a>. It is a great weekend to initiate the first timers to the Catholic culture, identity, and traditions at CUA. The weekend experience gives our new students opportunities to meet new friends, share personal stories, and spend time in prayer with others while also having a peaceful time to play games and explore the natural beauty of the region. What I usually find at the end of the retreat is a transformation — a new bond has been created between the freshmen. They return to the campus feeling more at home and energized because of the friendships they have found during the retreat. They came out of the long holiday weekend feeling grateful much like Peter, James, and John after their retreat experience with Jesus, Moses, and Elijah on Mount Tabor. Peter was so overjoyed by what he saw that he exclaimed, “It is good for us to be here!”</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Father Eric de la Pena</p></div><p>Moments of retreats are truly unique and graced encounters. They allow us to step out of the mundane, to refocus our attention on the essential things in life that often get sidelined because of our many preoccupations. Retreats are moments when we can re-prioritize our relationships both vertical — toward God — and horizontal — toward others. This has been the experience of our freshmen, and it is also the kind of experience that we foster in all the other <a
href="http://ministry.cua.edu/retreat/index.cfm">retreats </a>that we provide in Campus Ministry throughout the year.</p><p>Next year, another kind of retreat is being called for by Pope Francis. This one involves a pilgrimage for all the youth of the world. The 14th World Youth Day (WYD) will take place next year, during the Year of Mercy, July 25 – August 1. Pope Francis will lead this big gathering in Krakow, Poland. Providentially, the Shrine of Divine Mercy happens to be in the same city and that will allow many of the young pilgrims to visit the shrine and become acquainted with its beautiful message. Our university will take part in this pilgrimage as we have in the past. We will begin the pilgrimage in Rome and Assisi before proceeding to Krakow to join Catholic youth gathered there from around the world. I pray that moments like these — retreats, prayers, and pilgrimages — will keep us ever inspired and focused on the good work we have already begun.</p><p>— <em><a
