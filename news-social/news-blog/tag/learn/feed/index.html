Who has a ticket?” asks Paul Brazinski, a First Year Experience teaching fellow and doctoral church history student, of the freshmen in his “Faith, Seeking, Understanding” course.</p><p>Many hands go up. “Nice!” says Brazinski. “No homework on Wednesday, other than to see the Pope.”</p><p>Brazinski is taking advantage of this class on the Monday morning before the papal visit to lecture on the Holy Father’s life and his teachings.</p><p>Outside his Caldwell Hall classroom is the Campus Ministry garden featuring a small statue of St. Francis of Assisi. Referring to that, Brazinski asks his students why Pope Francis took on the name of this saint when he began his papacy.</p><p>“St. Francis is the patron of animals and the environment and he dedicated himself to the poor,” says one student.</p><p>“Bingo!” responds Brazinski as he reminds students of the often-told story of the dramatic moment so many centuries ago when St. Francis renounced his inheritance and dedicated his life to the poor and the environment. “When Pope Francis chose his name that gave us the first idea that these would be the themes of his papacy,” he says.</p><p>Brazinski tells the students what it was like on campus on March 13, 2013, when it was announced that Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina was elected to be the 266th pope.</p><p>“Students chanted ‘Habemus Papam!’ and I can still remember the bells ringing across campus.”</p><p>The lecture focuses on Pope Francis’s early life as a boy, as a chemical technician (who also had a job as a nightclub bouncer), as a scholar, and as a young priest. Brazinski’s PowerPoint details important milestones in the Popes’s life. And the class ends with a lively discussion of Laudato Si&#8217;, the Pope’s encyclical on the environment. The students have read selected excerpts from the encyclical in which Pope Francis appeals to ‘‘every person living on this planet” to play a role in “caring for our common home.”</p><p>Pope Francis’s visit to Catholic University has provided a unique teaching moment for faculty and staff. In addition to the pope’s teachings being worked into curriculum in anticipation of the Holy Father’s visit, Catholic University’s Office of Campus Ministry initiated a series of events with the theme “Walking with Francis: Joy of the Gospel.”</p><p>CUA students, alumni, faculty, and staff have taken the pledge to walk in solidarity with the Holy Father through prayer, learning, and service. More than 500 members of the CUA community took part in the Serve with Francis Day on Sept. 13.There were special Masses in Spanish to help students learn the assembly responses for a Spanish Mass. Learning events included a screening of the Salt + Light documentary “The Francis Effect,” a pope trivia night, a panel discussion titled “Follow Francis’s Footsteps: The Pope’s Guide to Modern Life,” and a lecture on “Junipero Serra: An Apostle of California.</p><p>“I am so excited for the Mass. It will bring happiness to so many souls,” says Rory Martinez, a student in Brazinski’s course. “Spanish is my first language. My grandmother is from Mexico and she always told me about seeing Pope John Paul II. I got my faith from her. Celebrating the Mass in Spanish will feel like home. And after today’s class I will be going into the Mass with great knowledge,” says the theology major from New Mexico.</p><p>&#8220;Pope Francis’s visit to our campus provides a great opportunity for our students and community,” says Brazinski. “In the months leading to his adventus, he has inspired us to serve, pray, and learn. From our numerous service days to our Fitness for Francis at the Kane Fitness Center, CUA has been awaiting the Holy Father and has enhanced its programming to honor his mission. His visit has truly provided a unique and invigorating opportunity for our University.&#8221;</p><p>“The visit of Pope Francis will be one of the most memorable events in the lives of Catholic University students, who hopefully will remember not only the event, but also the Pope’s message: his invitation to ‘walk’ as a person of faith throughout the rest of their lives,” says Rev. John T. Ford, professor of theology and religious studies, who delivered the lecture on Blessed Junípero Serra. The soon-to-be saint will be canonized by Pope Francis during the papal Mass.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/a-teaching-moment-for-the-university/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Papal Visit Book Discussion Series</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/papal-visit-book-discussion-series/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/papal-visit-book-discussion-series/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2015 19:31:03 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Lisa Carroll]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Preparing for the Pope]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Academic Events]]></category> <category><![CDATA[events]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Faculty]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Learn]]></category><guid

href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/peace/documents/papa-francesco_20141208_messaggio-xlviii-giornata-mondiale-pace-2015.html" target="_blank">World Day of Peace</a> this year called human trafficking an open wound upon the body of Christ,” said CUA President <a
href="http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/tag/president-john-garvey/">John Garvey</a>, who welcomed attendees to the University’s campus on July 9 at the start of the two-day conference titled “<a
href="http://ncsss.cua.edu/trafficking/index.cfm" target="_blank">Answering Pope Francis’s Call: An American Catholic Response to Modern-Day Slavery</a>.”</p><p>The conference was cosponsored by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB); Catholic Charities, D.C.; Catholic Charities, USA; and Catholic University’s National Catholic School of Social Service (NCSSS).</p><p>“Human beings made in the image and likeness of God are reduced to objects because there is a demand for it,” said Garvey, who noted that forced slavery is a multi-billion-dollar industry.</p><p>“The scourge of modern-day slavery is closer to us than we might want to admit. Unlike slavery of the 19th Century, the modern-day culture of enslavement ignores slaves all together.” The Church, Garvey said, is uniquely equipped to bring this problem to light and to address it.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Bishop Eusebio Elizondo (right) chats with conference participants.</p></div><p>In an opening address, Most Rev. Eusebio L. Elizondo, auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Seattle, also quoted from the Pope’s World Peace Day message. He said the Holy Father is making an urgent appeal to anyone who witnesses human slavery “not to become accomplices to this evil, not to turn away from the suffering of our brothers and sisters, our fellow human beings, who are deprived of their freedom and dignity.”</p><p>The bishop noted efforts under way to combat modern-day slavery, such as current legislation in Congress; the <a
href="http://www.usccb.org/about/anti-trafficking-program/" target="_blank">Amistad movement</a>, a national education campaign launched by USCCB’s Migration and Refugee Services; and USCCB’s <a
href="http://www.usccb.org/about/anti-trafficking-program/become-a-shepherd-tool-kit.cfm" target="_blank">SHEPHERD program</a>, which provides a toolkit for Catholic parishes to identify situations of human trafficking.</p><p>Bishop Elizondo also offered particular gratitude to women religious who he says have been committed to the struggle against slavery long before the problem began to make news. “Their long-standing efforts to provide love and support to survivors of human trafficking and a commitment to advocate on behalf of its victims are an example that brings glory to the Church and should be one that we all strive to imitate.”</p><p>Many women religious were in attendance, as well as Catholic Charities staff, other Catholic social service agencies, and community members from parishes across the nation. A large number of attendees were social workers, including many NCSSS alumni. Also represented were nurses, lawyers, and community activists.</p><p>Nearly 20 more speakers — scholars, law and policy experts, social workers, and leaders of social service agencies — addressed a wide range of topics including identifying potential victims, navigating social services, understanding the legal framework, building a toolkit for a parish community, and exploring current trends.</p><p>Two keynote speakers shared their personal stories of survival and advocacy.</p><p>Tina Frundt told her story of being trafficked from the age of 9 until her 20s. It started with foster families selling her. “When you are raped and abused for so long and no one believes you, you become angry. Abuse was my normal, it’s all I knew,” she said.</p><p>Even after she was adopted at age 12, she was always waiting for “the other shoe to drop.” That’s how, a few years later, a trafficker sensed her vulnerability, gained her trust, and eventually kidnapped her and forced her into prostitution.</p><p>A Catholic service agency in Washington, D.C., helped Frundt escape. “They didn’t judge ever, not one time, and told me I would do amazing things. The impact of not being judged is pretty spectacular,” said Frundt.</p><p>Today, she trains organizations and law enforcement officials on the issue of human trafficking. In 2008, she founded <a
href="http://www.courtneyshouse.org/" target="_blank">Courtney’s House</a>, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that assists victims and survivors of sex trafficking and sexual exploitation, and has helped more than 500 victims escape trafficking and start a new life. Through Courtney’s House, Fundt works with local parishes to identify those at risk in their congregations.</p><p>Starting at age 11, Gerardo Reyes-Chávez, the second speaker, worked as a peasant farmer in Zacatecas, Mexico, and later in the fields of Florida picking oranges, tomatoes, and watermelons. He told attendees of inhumane and sometimes violent working conditions hidden in the swamps of Imokalee, Fla.</p><p>Today, he is a leader in the <a
href="http://ciw-online.org/" target="_blank">Coalition of Immokalee Workers</a> in Florida. He has investigated several modern-day slavery operations by going undercover to work on tomato farms and interview workers who have escaped brutal operations, such as being locked in the back of trucks overnight. He has mobilized the Immokalee community around national actions for the Campaign for Fair Food, and he has negotiated with major food chains.</p><p>“This was a conference that was all about rolling up our sleeves and addressing the problem,” said William Rainford, dean of NCSSS. “The attendees are people on the front lines in their communities who are effecting change. There was an amazing sharing of information and a profound commitment to answering the Holy Father’s call to eliminate the atrocity of human trafficking.</p><p>“The conference was just the beginning of a strong Catholic partnership aimed at advocacy, prevention, and rescue — with the goal of eradicating human trafficking in our lifetime.”</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/catholic-groups-respond-to-pope-franciss-call-to-work-to-end-human-trafficking/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>John Garvey: Conference Responds to Pope&#8217;s Challenge to Combat Human Trafficking</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/john-garvey-conference-responds-to-popes-challenge-to-combat-human-trafficking/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/john-garvey-conference-responds-to-popes-challenge-to-combat-human-trafficking/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2015 15:03:49 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[bpollock]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[CUA Bloggers]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Academic Events]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Learn]]></category> <category><![CDATA[President John Garvey]]></category><guid

His talk provided insights into the Pope’s understanding of capitalism from his experiences in South America where capitalism is marred by classism and cronyism.</p><p><a

href="http://business.cua.edu/" target="_blank">School of Business and Economics</a>, presented the newly released findings from a survey titled “Faithful Measure: Gauging Awareness of the Catholic Church’s Social Doctrine.” This new data shows that Catholics and non-Catholics alike misunderstand key tenets of Catholic social doctrine. Most Catholics think they understand terms such as social justice, solidarity, and property rights, but when they are asked to identify their definitions, they do little better than non-Catholics.</p><p>&gt; <a
