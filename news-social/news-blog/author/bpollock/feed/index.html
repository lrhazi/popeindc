El pasado 23 de septiembre tuve la oportunidad, junto con otras miles de personas de escuchar y ver al Papa Francisco, así también como servir con él. Fue una experiencia inolvidable. No sólo estaba rodeada de amigos, profesores, colegas, alumnos y de otras muchas personas, sino que el Papa estaba hablando en mi idioma. Toda la preparación para recibir al Papa Francisco de pronto cobró aún más sentido. Fue maravilloso poder compartir la Misa en español con todos aquellos que me rodeaban, en un ambiente lleno de emoción y mucho amor. ¡Una experiencia maravillosa que se quedará por siempre conmigo!La universidad lucía hermosa, el clima era perfecto, el ambiente de todos los que nos encontrábamos era realmente espectacular, entre asistentes y voluntarios todos estábamos muy animados por recibir al Papa. El altar fuera de la Basílica se veía hermoso y escuchar al coro de la universidad fue una experiencia divina. Después de todo el esfuerzo invertido, de compartir un momento tan especial como la canonización de Junípero Serra, de escuchar las palabras de aliento del Papa Francisco, me fui a casa con el corazón lleno de alegría, “siempre adelante”, con la cabeza bien en alto porque fue mi universidad, la Universidad Católica de América, la que consiguió crear junto con todos nosotros un momento tan especial, importante e inolvidable.</p><p>La universidad lucía hermosa, el clima era perfecto, el ambiente de todos los que nos encontrábamos era realmente espectacular, entre asistentes y voluntarios todos estábamos muy animados por recibir al Papa.

On Sept. 23 I had the chance, with thousands of other people to listen to and see Pope Francis, as well as serving with him. It was an unforgettable experience. I was surrounded by friends, professors, colleagues, students and many other people, and, in addition to that, the Pope was speaking in my language! The whole preparation for welcoming the Pope suddenly made more sense. It was wonderful to be able to share Mass in Spanish with all of those surrounding me, in an exciting and loving environment. It is truly an experience that will stay with me forever!</p><p>The University campus looked beautiful; the weather was perfect; the feeling of all of us who were gathered there was truly spectacular. We, the people attending and the volunteers, were very thrilled to welcome the Pope. The altar outside of the Basilica was just beautiful and listening to the University’s choir was a holy experience. After all the effort put on this event, of sharing a special moment like the canonization of Junípero Serra, of listening to the inspirational words of Pope Francis, I went home with my heart full of joy. “Moving forward”, with my head up, feeling proud because my university, The Catholic University of America, was the one that created such a special, important, and unforgettable moment for all of us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>– <i>Patricia G.

class="wp-caption-text">Lucia Silecchia</p></div><p>As I think of Pope Francis’s time here with us, and his celebration of the canonization Mass in our midst, there are many things, some quick snapshots that I will always remember:</p><p>The joy of the crowd that grew each minute that the Mass drew closer.</p><p>The random meetings with people from so many parts of my life — my parish, my circle of friends, my students, my colleagues, and even my local Dunkin Donuts — all gathered in the same place for the same sacred reason.</p><p>The lump that came to my throat when the carillon rang out our joyful expectation.</p><p>The remarkable simplicity of the canonization rite.</p><p>Hearing “<em>Rejoice in the Lord always</em> …” and realizing that one of my favorite scripture passages, the one I read at my brother’s wedding, was the one I was about to hear proclaimed on yet another special day.</p><p>The hymns both familiar and new that praised God in the many ways we strive to capture awe and love in song.</p><p>The jubilant laps in the Popemobile and the reverence of the Mass that followed.</p><p>The expected smiles of sharing the day with loved ones, and the unexpected tears that came from realizing that there are loved ones with whom I can no longer share great days like this. (Gratefully, tears not captured on the JumboTron.)</p><p>And the gift of receiving the Eucharist in that unexplained moment filled with the paradox that the most quiet and intimate moment with God can be in a crowd of thousands.</p><p>Were I to write about all these things, this post would be far too long! So, instead, I’ll let the last words be Pope Francis’s. As he prepared to leave the United States, his parting remarks began:</p><blockquote><p><em>“My days with you have been brief. But they have been days of great grace for me and, I pray, for you too. Please know that as I prepare to leave, I do so with a heart full of gratitude and hope.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Indeed, his days with us were brief. They were days of great grace for me and, I pray, for you too. As he prepared to leave, I saw him do so with a heart full of gratitude and hope.</p><p><em>— <a

I cannot believe that it actually happened. There was a time before the papal visit that I could not believe that the Holy Father was actually coming to CUA, and now I cannot believe that he actually came to our campus. I must say that I had no idea what it would feel like to experience a papal Mass, in the United States, in the District, at Catholic University.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Greta Haussmann</p></div><p>The real reason that I am experiencing this “papal withdrawal” is because there was such a joyous attitude in our nation and on our campus as we prepared for the Apostolic Visit of Pope Francis. People couldn’t stop talking about all of the beautiful words and actions of the Pope, people were in awe of our Holy Father, and they wanted nothing more than to meet him. People were desperately trying to learn more about the Holy Father and the Catholic Church — there was a sense of renewal happening all around me.</p><p>It is disappointing to admit that this joyous attitude that Pope Francis’s visit elicited is slowly fading. We are falling back into our monotonous routines and mundane habits. We are allowing ourselves to forget the grace and joy that we were so blessed to experience a few short weeks ago. It is important for all of us to remember that Pope Francis did not come to elicit momentary emotions; rather he came to renew our spirits so that in turn we can renew the Church and share in the mission of the New Evangelization.</p><p>In his apostolic exhortation <em>Evangelii Gaudium</em>, Pope Francis calls us to live the joy of the gospel daily: “I invite all Christians, everywhere, at this very moment, to a renewed personal encounter with Jesus Christ, or at least an openness to letting him encounter them; I ask all of you to do this unfailingly each day.”</p><p>Whether waiting for Pope Francis motorcade to drive by or waiting for class to start, remember that you are called to be the joy of the Gospel. Let us all learn from Pope Francis’s apostolic visit that we are all fitted to proclaim the New Evangelization with our very lives.</p><p><em>— Greta Haussmann is a junior at <a

The program included readings in English and the Native American Chochenyo language. Following the Homily, a Universal Prayer included lines read in Korean, American Sign Language, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Igbo, and Creole.</p><div

On big screens, the early faithful watched Pope Francis on his parade route along the Ellipse. They cheered along with those who had lined the streets for a glimpse of the Pontiff.</p><p>In their seats at noon, CUA alumni Elizabeth Briones, B.A. 2014, and Jacqueline Corbin-Armstrong, B.A 1985, M.S.M. 2015, marveled at the view of the altar and made fast friends. “Catholic University is my home. It was very important for me to come back and be here for the visit of the Holy Father,” Briones said.</p><p>“I agree,” said Corbin-Armstrong. “It’s so wonderful to be back on campus and to celebrate Mass with this community that is like family.” After Mass, Corbin-Armstrong is headed to the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia where she hopes to see Pope Francis again, after serving as music director on Friday for an Archdiocese of the Military Services Mass.</p><p>Susana Quinonez, who is originally from Peru, became emotional when she saw her seat and her view of the altar. She is an employee of Georgetown University, and got her ticket from a co-worker who won it through the university’s lottery and gave it to Quinonez knowing what this Mass means to her.</p><p>“This is a dream come true,” said Quinonez. “It touches my heart and soul that the Mass will be celebrated in my native language.”</p><p>Many students established their turf early in the standing-room section in hopes of getting a good view of Pope Francis when he arrives on campus.</p><p>“This Pope is someone you want to emulate,” said Ryan Goldschmidt, a senior nursing student from Hillsborough, N.J. “It will be amazing to see him here, and to show our school off to the world.”</p><p>With four hours to go before Mass, friends from the class of 1988, Lisa Geis and Tracey McCormack, were catching up when they realized this would be the first time they were attending Mass together since their Baccalaureate Mass. “It’s pretty cool to share this experience with old friends.”</p><p><iframe

In the relative calm before 25,000 ticket holders began coming through the security check points, many took time to reflect on the meaning of the day.</p><p>“I feel so much pride that my alma mater and the place I work is hosting the Pope. What a powerful moment. My prayer on the way here this morning was that this papal visit will change people. For those with strong faith, that it will only get deeper. For those lost in their faith, that this will plant a seed of hope,” said Emmjolee Mendoza Waters, associate director of Campus Ministry.</p><p>“This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” said freshman business major Sarah Lynch.  “I decided the minute we got the email this summer about the opportunity to volunteer that that’s what I wanted to do.”</p><p>Her friend Briana Marcinauskis, also a freshman business major, agreed. “I didn’t want to just watch it, I wanted to be a part of it. I want to walk with Francis and that’s why I volunteered.”</p><p>Kyra Lyons, executive director of the Office of Alumni Relations, is on duty as a seating volunteer and as she geared up to take her spot on the lawn, she said she was looking forward to seeing alumni back on campus for this historic event. “I’m so pleased that we were able to provide tickets to so many alumni. What a wonderful occasion for them to reconnect with their alma mater. I can’t wait to see them all and share our pride in Catholic University.”</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/volunteers-in-place-early-with-anticipation/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Anderson Cooper&#8217;s CUA Filming Draws a Crowd of Students</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/anderson-coopers-cua-filming-draws-a-crowd-of-students/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/anderson-coopers-cua-filming-draws-a-crowd-of-students/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 23 Sep 2015 00:39:56 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[bpollock]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[News]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Pope at CUA]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Preparing for the Pope]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Media]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Students]]></category><guid

In this case, doing it in preparation for the Pope’s visit alongside my teammates made it a special experience.”</p><p>&gt; <a
