The crowd of 25,000 worshippers seated and standing on grassy areas across CUA’s campus erupted in cheers. They chanted <em>Viva El Papa</em> as the Holy Father made his way down Senior Walk on the University Mall. He waved to the crowds and flashed his infectious smile.</p><p>Many of CUA’s students were positioned behind the bike rack fencing in standing room sections along the short parade route. They had been waiting under bright blue skies since the morning. And the moment did not disappoint. The Pontiff who wears sensible shoes and urges his followers to care for the poor and the environment was in their presence.</p><p>“I tried to prepare spiritually for this day. But it didn’t really hit me until the moment that he rode past and waved to us,” said Claudia Seckinger, a junior psychology major from Vero Beach, Fla. “That is something that will live in my heart. To see the Holy Father up close and to attend a papal Mass is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.”</p><p>“It was amazing. It was the highlight of my life,” said Shannon Edgar, a sophomore politics major from Pittsburgh, who was standing in section D, a prime location to view the arrival of the Popemobile.</p><p>The Pope’s visit to Catholic University and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception to celebrate Mass and canonize Blessed Junipero Serra took months of planning. Excitement had been building on campus since April when it was officially announced that Pope Francis would be coming.</p><p>“I was here when Pope Francis was elected in March 2013. I remember the bells ringing on campus,” said Jacob Maclin, a senior mechanical engineering student from Cleveland, Ohio. “I had heard stories of when Pope Benedict XVI visited CUA in 2008, and I never imagined this new pope would visit before I graduated. This means so much to me. I’ve gone to Catholic school all my life. This is beyond exciting.”</p><p>It took 1,000 volunteers to prepare the campus to welcome 25,000 pilgrims from across the nation. Cecilia Cicone, a senior theology student from Newark, Del., was one of more than 500 students who were part of that volunteer squad. “It was so cool to be involved in the distribution of Holy Eucharist as a Communion escort, which is the whole reason we celebrate Mass. My dad saw me on national TV as I stood with a Deacon. He took a picture of the screen and texted it to me.”</p><p>Shelby Kestler, a senior politics major from Baltimore, was also a student volunteer. “I feel so lucky. I saw the Holy Father during my semester in Rome and now I got to see him again on his first trip to the United States,” she said. “We are <em>The</em> Catholic University of America. I don’t know where else I could get these opportunities. In May, I will celebrate my graduation in the very spot where Pope Francis celebrated Mass. We are pretty lucky.”</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/once-in-a-lifetime-the-pope-in-our-presence/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Pope Francis Challenges Congregation: ‘Rejoice in the Lord Always’</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/pope-francis-challenges-congregation-rejoice-in-the-lord-always/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/pope-francis-challenges-congregation-rejoice-in-the-lord-always/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2015 00:43:05 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[bpollock]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[News]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Pope at CUA]]></category> <category><![CDATA[The Papal Mass]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Basilica]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Cardinal Donald Wuerl]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Church]]></category> <category><![CDATA[CUA Symphony Orchestra]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Eucharist]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Junípero Serra]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Leo Nestor]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Mass]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><guid

The massive congregation gathered on the University Mall, in crowds that spread from the front of the Basilica to Mullen Library and beyond.</p><p>Pope Francis began his homily with a message of joy.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Deacons, accompanied by student volunteers, process to Mass in order to distribute communion.</p></div><p>“Rejoice in the Lord always,” he said. “I’ll say it again: Rejoice in the Lord always.”</p><p>Rather than settling for earthly pleasures and “things that are comfortable,” the Pope told the massive congregation to avoid falling into apathy, “a habit with a fatal consequence: our hearts go numb.”</p><p>Continuing, the Pope said Christians should live out their joyful faith by proclaiming the Gospel to the entire world — going out “to the highways” — and sharing the good news without judgment or condescension.</p><p>“Jesus would not provide a short list of who is or who is not worthy of receiving his presence,” Pope Francis said.</p><p>Pope Francis also spoke highly of St. Junípero, calling him “the embodiment of a church which goes forth.” He said people should follow in his example by following the new saint’s motto in life: “Siempre Adelante,” which translates to “Keep moving forward.”</p><p>The Mass, which was celebrated in Spanish, was intended to shine a light on the diverse Catholic community in the United States and the Washington Metropolitan Area. The program included readings in English and the Native American Chochenyo language. Following the Homily, a Universal Prayer included lines read in Korean, American Sign Language, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Igbo, and Creole.</p><div

The orchestra performed under the direction of Simeone Tartaglione, the orchestra’s music director, while the chamber choir was conducted by Leo Nestor, Justine Bayard Ward Professor and director of choral studies and CUA’s Institute of Sacred Music.</p><p>Several alumni and faculty members composed original works for the visit, including Nestor. Nestor’s compositions for the Mass included the introit, the communion antiphon, and an original work, “I am the Living Bread,” that was performed during the communion rite.</p><p>Following the Holy Eucharist, which was distributed by more than 200 deacons accompanied by student volunteers, Cardinal Donald Wuerl gave a short address to the Pope and those in attendance.</p><p>“Not far from here in 1634, the first Catholics arrived in what is now the United States and began the evangelization effort that we see so wonderfully realized today at this great Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and the campus of The Catholic University of America,” Cardinal Wuerl said.</p><p>“As we seek today to enrich our human culture with the great love — love of God and love of neighbor, we also try to care for our common home, the good earth,” he continued. “We take seriously your call in <em>Laudato Sí</em> to face the challenges of our day and to do so with respect for the dignity of each person; concern for one another, especially the marginalized and the poor; and care for the good earth, God’s gift to us now and for generations to come.”</p><p>Thanking the Holy Father for visiting the University and the United States, Cardinal Wuerl continued:  “We look to you, Holy Father, for renewed inspiration so that we might truly be evangelizers.”</p><p>&gt; <a

Standing in the Popemobile, he greeted cheering people along the way around the Basilica circle, past Gibbons Hall, and turned left onto Senior Walk on the University Mall. All along the way students and other guests reached out to him, cheered and called out greetings. The Pope waved to the crowd along the mall, turned in front of McMahon Hall, dove past the Mary Seat of Wisdom circle, then the Popemobile turned around and followed the same route back to the Basilica, where the Pope entered the building to greet the seminarians and religious novices gathered there.</p><p><iframe

On big screens, the early faithful watched Pope Francis on his parade route along the Ellipse. They cheered along with those who had lined the streets for a glimpse of the Pontiff.</p><p>In their seats at noon, CUA alumni Elizabeth Briones, B.A. 2014, and Jacqueline Corbin-Armstrong, B.A 1985, M.S.M. 2015, marveled at the view of the altar and made fast friends. “Catholic University is my home. It was very important for me to come back and be here for the visit of the Holy Father,” Briones said.</p><p>“I agree,” said Corbin-Armstrong. “It’s so wonderful to be back on campus and to celebrate Mass with this community that is like family.” After Mass, Corbin-Armstrong is headed to the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia where she hopes to see Pope Francis again, after serving as music director on Friday for an Archdiocese of the Military Services Mass.</p><p>Susana Quinonez, who is originally from Peru, became emotional when she saw her seat and her view of the altar. She is an employee of Georgetown University, and got her ticket from a co-worker who won it through the university’s lottery and gave it to Quinonez knowing what this Mass means to her.</p><p>“This is a dream come true,” said Quinonez. “It touches my heart and soul that the Mass will be celebrated in my native language.”</p><p>Many students established their turf early in the standing-room section in hopes of getting a good view of Pope Francis when he arrives on campus.</p><p>“This Pope is someone you want to emulate,” said Ryan Goldschmidt, a senior nursing student from Hillsborough, N.J. “It will be amazing to see him here, and to show our school off to the world.”</p><p>With four hours to go before Mass, friends from the class of 1988, Lisa Geis and Tracey McCormack, were catching up when they realized this would be the first time they were attending Mass together since their Baccalaureate Mass. “It’s pretty cool to share this experience with old friends.”</p><p><iframe

class="wp-caption-text">Members of the CUA Symphony Orchestra are seen in Ward Hall hours before the Papal Mass.</p></div><p>“It’s such an amazing experience,” she said. “It still hasn’t quite hit me how big of a deal this is. I think my brain knows it, but I don’t know if I’m going to really understand it for a little while.”</p><p>DeGeorgia was also excited that the Pope would come to her own University campus.</p><p>“It’s so special for the people who are here right now,” she said. “As musicians, our goal for today is to glorify God through the gifts we’ve been given.”</p><p>Christine Laird, a master’s student and member of the chamber choir, was walking toward Ward Hall at the same time. She said she also had a hard time comprehending what the day would be like.</p><p>“We’ve been rehearsing for several weeks, but I don’t think we quite get the magnitude of it,” she said. “I don&#8217;t think it will be until it’s all put together, when all the people are here, that we will finally understand and see what we are singing for. It’s going to be really overwhelming.”</p><p>Downstairs in Ward Hall, a trio of brass players were retrieving their instruments and warming up in the piano lab.</p><p>Junior Matthew Fitzsimmons, a trumpet player, said he felt honored and excited to be playing a role in today’s papal Mass.</p><p>“It’s hard to believe that it’s actually happening,” he said. “I’ve never been part of something this big. It’s a huge honor.”</p><p>Freshman Christopher Gillie, a french horn player, was also warming up before the Mass, which more than 25,000 people are expected to attend.</p><p>“This is definitely nerve-wracking,” he said. “This is the largest audience I’ll probably ever play for — probably the largest audience anyone here will ever play for.”</p><p>Having only started college a month ago, Gillie said the rehearsals for the papal Mass were a great way to meet other students, alumni, and local musicians.</p><p>“I didn’t know I’d have this opportunity,” he said. “It’s a pretty cool way to start my college career.”</p><p>Faculty member Eric Moore, who teaches french horn, was also eagerly awaiting the day’s Mass. A former member of the U.S. Navy Band, Moore said he has played for presidents and other government officials in the past, but that playing for a pope is unique.</p><p>“I came up here on the Metro and saw people who have come from long distances for this,” Moore said. “As a musician, this is different. It’s not like playing for a military or political figure. This is something bigger than that and more inspiring than that.”</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/university-musicians-our-goal-is-to-glorify-god/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Volunteers in Place Early with Anticipation</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/volunteers-in-place-early-with-anticipation/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/volunteers-in-place-early-with-anticipation/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 23 Sep 2015 15:19:28 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[bpollock]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[News]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Preparing for the Pope]]></category> <category><![CDATA[The Papal Mass]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Alumni]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Mass]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Preparations]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Volunteers]]></category><guid

In the relative calm before 25,000 ticket holders began coming through the security check points, many took time to reflect on the meaning of the day.</p><p>“I feel so much pride that my alma mater and the place I work is hosting the Pope. What a powerful moment. My prayer on the way here this morning was that this papal visit will change people. For those with strong faith, that it will only get deeper. For those lost in their faith, that this will plant a seed of hope,” said Emmjolee Mendoza Waters, associate director of Campus Ministry.</p><p>“This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” said freshman business major Sarah Lynch.  “I decided the minute we got the email this summer about the opportunity to volunteer that that’s what I wanted to do.”</p><p>Her friend Briana Marcinauskis, also a freshman business major, agreed. “I didn’t want to just watch it, I wanted to be a part of it. I want to walk with Francis and that’s why I volunteered.”</p><p>Kyra Lyons, executive director of the Office of Alumni Relations, is on duty as a seating volunteer and as she geared up to take her spot on the lawn, she said she was looking forward to seeing alumni back on campus for this historic event. “I’m so pleased that we were able to provide tickets to so many alumni. What a wonderful occasion for them to reconnect with their alma mater. I can’t wait to see them all and share our pride in Catholic University.”</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/volunteers-in-place-early-with-anticipation/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Anderson Cooper&#8217;s CUA Filming Draws a Crowd of Students</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/anderson-coopers-cua-filming-draws-a-crowd-of-students/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/anderson-coopers-cua-filming-draws-a-crowd-of-students/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 23 Sep 2015 00:39:56 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[bpollock]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[News]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Pope at CUA]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Preparing for the Pope]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Media]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Students]]></category><guid

class="wp-caption-text">Student volunteers label chairs for Wednesday&#8217;s papal Mass.</p></div><p>As musicians — including the CUA Symphony Orchestra and the University Chamber Choir — practice their pieces on a side stage, reporters from local and national television stations are readying their camera equipment on top of the newly-constructed media riser in front of John K. Mullen of Denver Library. Faculty experts have been speaking with the media, including President John Garvey, who joined reporter Lester Holt from NBC Nightly News for an interview on the roof of O’Connell Hall.</p><p>The liturgical committee is in high gear at the Basilica, preparing the altar, hanging the crucifix, and preparing tens of thousands of communion wafers — including a low-gluten variety — for tomorrow’s Mass.</p><p>Elsewhere on campus, students are navigating new routes as they walk between classes, which are still in session. In addition to the large number of bike racks put in place earlier this month for security reasons, students now face new obstacles: rows of porta-potties, ATMs, and quickly constructed food and souvenir stands.</p><p>Many students have been finding time during the day to investigate the scene on the University Mall, where 15,000 seats have been set up and numbered in preparation for the canonization Mass.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Student Victor Esposito is seen with his tickets to view Pope Francis&#8217;s address to Congress from the Capital.</p></div><p>In the early afternoon, students lined up at the information desk in the Edward J. Pryzbyla University Center, where the office of Jon Sawyer, associate vice president for student affairs and the dean of students, was distributing 700 tickets for students to view the Pope’s address to a joint meeting of Congress from the West Front of the Capital. The tickets were awarded to the University from the House of Representatives.</p><p>Freshman Briana Marcinauskis was among the students who received a ticket to the Capital.</p><p>“I was going back and forth (on whether I wanted the tickets) because I know I’m going to be so tired, but then I thought, ‘It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she said. “I got down (to the Pryzbyla Center) and they had five left so I grabbed two of them.”</p><p>Walking around campus the day before Pope Francis’s visit is “a little overwhelming,” Marcinauskis said. “Hearing all the music all day has been crazy, but people are really excited.”</p><p><iframe

But on Saturday, Sept. 19, the orchestra performed for a significantly different audience: the clients of the interfaith community-based organization SOME (So Others Might Eat).</p><p>As a nonprofit, SOME provides food and support to the poor and homeless in Washington, D.C. According to the organization’s website, there are 7,298 homeless men, women, and children living in D.C. SOME serves them by offering affordable housing, job training, addiction treatment, and mental health counseling.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Members of the Symphony Orchestra perform at SOME (So Others Might Eat) Sept. 19.</p></div><p>On Saturday, the orchestra performed two pieces for the clients in the SOME dining room, as clients were eating lunches of chicken and rice. Works performed included Mendelssohn’s Italian Symphony No. 4, first movement, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5, fourth movement.</p><p>University faculty Simeone Tartaglione, director of the orchestra, said the event was intended to help students prepare spiritually for the papal visit.<br
/> “Pope Francis is really an inspiration for us,” Tartaglione said. “He inspired us to bring the pieces we’re going to do for him to the people who won’t be there.</p><p>“As a Catholic institution, we should remind our students that life has different conditions and that it’s not a matter of fault or guilt,” he said. “This is something we can do. We can be a sign, plant a seed in somebody maybe to help them look for something better.”</p><p>Violinist Shinya Blattmann, who is pursuing her master’s degree in performance, said she is thrilled at the opportunity to play during Wednesday’s papal Mass.<br
/> “I think it’s going to be a highlight of my life,” she said.</p><p>For her, playing at SOME was a good reminder of her own blessings.</p><p>“We can go to the Kennedy Center or to a concert anytime we want, but they can’t do that,” she said. “It’s nice to play for them and to see them happy.”</p><p>Likewise, violinist Aurora Wheeland, a student in the school of law, said she was happy to bring classical music to people who may not ordinarily have access.</p><p>“A lot of times, people think of classical music as kind of an elitist thing, but it’s meant to be shared with everybody,” she said. “I find that everybody can respond to classical music, whether it’s their favorite kind of music or they’ve never been exposed to it before. It’s really powerful.”</p><p>David Peterson, a first-year doctoral student in conducting, will be one of the cover conductors for Wednesday’s papal Mass. He said the concert at SOME was a way for the musicians to connect with those in need in the local community.</p><p>“If we can give this music to people and even one person can dream for half an hour, then it’s worth it for me,” he said. “Everyone is here because they want to be here. Our call time this morning was 10 a.m. and people were at the School of Music at 9:30 ready to go.”</p><p>David Bond, who is earning his master’s in conducting, has been working as the manager of the orchestra in preparation for the papal Mass. Over the past few weeks, he said he has enjoyed making arrangements and seeing the alumni who have come back to play in the orchestra. He said the concert at SOME was a good opportunity for the musicians to share their gifts with those in need.</p><p>“These people need food of course, but I think they also need beauty and art and music in their lives,” he said. “The Pope is so invested in the lives of the lowest of the low and in my opinion, playing beautiful music is a way to help them that is right up there with feeding them. Everyone has their gift to give.”</p><p><iframe
