This is my second year as a resident assistance, and during training this year, we were updated and given a brief idea of what the days leading up to the papal Mass would be like. Already, I was excited for how this would affect the University&#8217;s community, and also how it would affect me on an individual level.</p><p>Fast-forwarding  to the Mass, I was fortunate to have received a ticket in Section D. This section was standing room only, and mostly comprised of students from CUA. I arrived at the line with a group of friends for the orange gate at about 11:45, and the line moved quite fast. During the Mass, I had the opportunity to stand next to the news tower, while having a perfect view of the entire altar where Pope Francis would celebrate the Mass.</p><p>Upon Pope Francis&#8217;s arrival, there was not a quiet soul in the crowd. At first, we all were following his path via the teleprompter. Then, as if a wave carried over section D, the roar of students and faculty alike was incredible. The sheer excitement of each person was heart-warming. To have a love for such a person, and to feel the impact he has on the Catholic following, for lack of a better word, is amazing.</p><p>For me, personally, I had a hard time preparing for the Pope&#8217;s arrival. The set-up, standards, and protocol that needed to be met somewhat distracted me during the days and hours leading up to Pope Francis&#8217;s arrival. I don&#8217;t think it truly reached me until I saw him for myself. The real impact hit when he began the Mass, uttering the first blessing. Pope Francis began the first blessing and once he spoke &#8220;and through the Holy Spirit,&#8221; my friends and I felt the rush of the wind consume the audience. It had been stagnant with only small gusts of wind earlier that day. I truly felt like the presence of the Holy Spirit was with all of us.</p><p>I think that the presence of the Holy Father is still affecting each and every person on this campus. To have been able to experience such an amazing opportunity, a man who has had such an influence on the Catholic following – especially the younger generations – is something I will really value. Thinking back now, the entire experience seems like a blink of an eye, and to be honest, unreal. The strength in his homily reminds me to &#8220;keep moving forward.&#8221; This past year has personally been difficult. I have been given some hard obstacles that have not been physically easy on me or my family. Pope Francis reminds all of us to joy in our lives, and keep moving forward.</p><p>– <em>Claudia Seckinger is a junior at <a

We were all in the McMahon Hall foyer around 3:30 p.m. when everything seemed to be slowing down and Dean Jennings [Kathryn Jennings is Senior Associate Dean of Students and Director of Campus Activities] let us know that we could go out onto the steps. She had mentioned that the runners would have a chance to get a good view, but I wasn&#8217;t expecting to have that great position!</p><p>I was lucky enough to study abroad in Rome last semester so it was not my first time seeing the Pope this year, but there is definitely something special about seeing Pope Francis on our campus. I am from 20 minutes outside of Philadelphia so I knew that there were plans for him to go there. I was in Rome when the announcement that he was coming to CUA happened, and I remember being excited that a connection I had to my semester abroad was continuing into my next year back at CUA. I had the opportunity to help with a lot of the volunteer planning process, and it was a very satisfying feeling to see all of our hard work pay off and the entire day go smoothly. Seeing Pope Francis in the Popemobile right in front of me at CUA brought it full circle, and brought together all the experiences I have had over this past year and brought a smile to my face. It was truly something I will never forget.</p><p>I saw the Popemobile go by and thought that he was just going to do one pass. He was past the trees next to McMahon when he told the [driver] to turn around and go back down the route. I wasn&#8217;t too surprised when he turned around, since I had seen him do it in St. Peter&#8217;s Square but I remember the person next to me was very surprised and was yelling and jumping around. It really made the start of my senior year exciting!</p><p>– <em>Meg Ross is a member of <a

My corner of the lawn housed an enclave of people intimately connected to CUA Press, and I realized profoundly that we truly are—both the Press and the University of which it is part – a family, a community, a church. United in prayer, praise, and the Eucharist were a cluster of wonderful people who keep the Press going, whether my friends and colleagues on staff, professors who are our authors or serve as editors for our journals, or faculty members of our editorial committee.  I appreciated more fully, and was humbled by, how at the Press we rejoice in each other and attempt, in the words of Saint Junípero, to “keep moving forward.”</p><p>Close by was a group from the Archdiocese of San Francisco, taking delight in the canonization of a saint to whom they have special ties. They joyfully punctuated the afternoon with shouts of “¡Viva el Papa!” and, movingly, the last words of the saintly martyred Jesuit Miguel Pro – “¡Viva el Cristo Rey!” These welcome guests to our campus energized the day with their passion and fervor for Christ the King and their love of Pope Francis, serving for me as a reminder that our church consists of people from far and wide, from many different countries, and who speak many different languages.</p><p>We were a small campus reflecting a large church—May it always be so!</p><p><em>&#8211; Trevor Lipscomb is the director of The Catholic University of America Press.</em></p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/lipscomb-reflection/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Lucia Silecchia: Remembering Simple, Joyful, Unexpected, Grace-filled Moments</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/silecchia-reflection/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/silecchia-reflection/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2016 17:00:10 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Patricia Diaz Suzarte]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Reflections]]></category><guid

In 1979, I entered the student lottery and won a ticket to witness John Paul II’s address to faculty in higher education, a particularly memorable experience for an undergrad religious studies major.</p><p>In what seems like a lifetime later, in the semester of my promotion to full professor of Hispanic Theology and Ministry, I entered another lottery, as an alum, and was gifted with the rare opportunity to see up close and hear yet another Pope at my alma mater.</p><p>Following the Mass, I was walking down North Capitol Street at dusk, the only option with a reasonable expectation of getting home, when the unexpected occurred. While standing on a corner waiting to cross the street, a motorcade approached, with its distinctive Fiat 500L. Six strangers – African Americans and Latinas – we started jumping up and down, all inhibition gone, waving at the driver side tinted window, excited just to know Papa Francisco was passing by. Suddenly above the roof of the car from the passenger side a white-sleeved arm emerged and a hand waved in our direction. We had been seen by the Pope! In a flash he was gone, leaving six strangers stunned by a blessing that made us, in that moment, a community celebrating a touch of the sacred.</p><p>– <em>Carmen Nanko-Fernández (B.A. 1980, M.A. 1984, D.Min. 1991) is a professor of Hispanic theology and ministry, Catholic Theological Union at Chicago.</em></p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/nanko-reflection/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Anne Reeser: ‘What a Wonderful Group of Students You Have at CUA’</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/reeser-reflection/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/reeser-reflection/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2016 14:00:29 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Patricia Diaz Suzarte]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Reflections]]></category><guid

I am an online doctoral student who flew in from Jacksonville, Florida on Tuesday night and came to campus at 10:15 a.m. prior to the gates opening at 11 a.m. Section D was a fantastic place to be with some of the best view of Pope Francis and the entire Mass and celebration.</p><p>The event was very organized and seemed to flow smoothly for all those who followed instructions. All of the students I had encountered were pleasant, happy, smiling, respectful, mannerly, and full of school pride – a real credit to CUA. I sat with a group of students for several hours while we waited, and they were a true pleasure to be around. The volunteers worked so hard and were extremely helpful, and continued to smile and be helpful and pleasant to all those they encountered.</p><p>I had heard on EWTN that there were some complaints from people not being able to get to their ticketed seats. I will tell you first-hand the reason for this was that they arrived late and did not follow the instructions, but still expected to &#8220;be seated by someone&#8221; after the Secret Service closed their area. At this point, they proceeded to walk through section D, pushing their way through all of the students, and myself, who had been sitting there for at least 3 hours waiting as we were told. But, as students of CUA, they remained kind and respectful, making room for everyone.</p><p>CUA did an excellent job in coordinating every aspect of this event. The security at the gate was extremely thorough and all of the officers and security did a phenomenal job keeping us all safe.</p><p>I just wanted to express my thanks and let you know what a wonderful group of students you have at CUA. This makes me proud to have chosen CUA and proud of each one of them, wishing you and them every wonderful blessing now and in the future.</p><p>– <em>Anne Reeser, MSN, ARNP-BC</em>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/reeser-reflection/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Amanda Sheffer: Seeing Languages as Key to Understanding Things from Another&#8217;s Perspective</title><link>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/sheffer-reflection/</link> <comments>http://popeindc.cua.edu/news-social/news-blog/sheffer-reflection/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2016 13:00:46 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Patricia Diaz Suzarte]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Reflections]]></category><guid

The student newspaper, the Tower, also encouraged the student population to pray in Spanish as part of the &#8220;Walk with Francis&#8221; program so they could better understand their faith through the eyes of our Pontiff.</p><p>This emphasis on not only seeing others and recognizing their needs, but truly understanding things from another&#8217;s perspective was the highlight of the experience for me.

Truthfully, when I was on the altar with Pope Francis, I was mainly focused on the tasks I had to perform – preparing the chalice, incensing the Holy Father, etc. – rather than the meaning or feeling of the experience. However, when I turned my phone back on after the Mass, I immediately received numerous text messages from family and friends, showing pictures of me and the Pope on their TV screens, and expressing excitement for me. It was a great blessing to see the experience through their eyes, and know that somehow they felt more connected to and blessed by Pope Francis through me. The Holy Father’s ministry unifies all the local churches throughout the world, and ultimately unites us back through time to St. Peter, the rock on whom the Church is founded, so in that moment I served to unite my family and friends to that larger reality. For me, as a seminarian, deacon, and future priest, it simply reminded me that I am meant to be a “man for others&#8221; – an instrument that God uses to give his grace to his people.</p><p><em>&#8211; Deacon Keith Burney is a fourth-year theology student of the <a

It seemed so appropriate for our Latin-American Pope to come to America, to canonize a Spanish-speaking missionary who worked to spread the Gospel, and to do it in Spanish! I felt proud because speaking Spanish has always been a way to connect to my roots and my family in South America.</p><p>I had the privilege of attending the Mass and it was a memory I’ll never forget. Perhaps the most important moment for me of this whole experience was realizing that it was taking place at the lawn of the Basilica in my university. I remember my mom telling me, “I’m so happy you decided to go to CUA!” I can honestly say I have never felt prouder to be a Cardinal.</p><p><em>&#8211; Maria Daniela Thurber is a member of <a
